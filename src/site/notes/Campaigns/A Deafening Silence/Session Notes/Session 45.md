Retroactive Genia/Skye conversation

The Count draws power from Mordresh, not necessarily that he was granted power. Genia tells them a little bit about her relationship with her patron, but says that other warlocks could be different. They decide they should ask Talbot what he knows about the Count and his magical prowess. Skye raises some concerns about Talbot and the Count and whether we can actually trust them. Genia says she's not sure, but she doesn't trust him 100% either. Genia asks if they had to give up something big, and Skye says they're not sure.

Genia asks Talbot about the Count's power, is he magical or charismatic or a good fighter? His power in Cape Lamar is explicitly financial. Talbot is unsure of any magical abilities he might possess.

Sergeant Jones and three other soldiers are left after the fight. The Captain thanks us all for our help, but unfortunately not all of his men made it out. He asks the sergeant to take the wounded back to camp, and then turns to us.

Captain Lannery, the leader of the expedition. He tells us about the creatures they ran into awhile back, and Zephyr and I have both heard of them. They're some sort of scavenger called [[carrion-crawler\|carrion-crawler]], though we've never heard of them getting this big.

[Lockie says something about the Duergar, I completely miss it cause I'm looking at warhammers.]

We agree to go in and go after some of Lannery's men that got separated. There are some torches left from the previous expedition. We see blood left in the office/administration area, and Viri says we should go investigate.

Viri sneaks up to the office door, and doesn't hear anything. She can see a small haphazard hole kicked into the bottom of the door. She tosses a rock in, and hears some wood creaking inside, but it doesn't really sound like footsteps. Viri asks Teras to deal with it, and he charges the door.

We head in. Skye hears some more creaking behind the wall to our left. Genia sees a door that says 'Mine Warden'. Skye and Viri warn her they heard noise from that direction, so Genia puts her ear to the door. She hears nothing. Genia turns the handle on the mine warden door. We don't see anything inside, but Teras asks Viri to throw a rock. Nothing happens so Teras and Genia walk in...roll initiative!

Rd 1
- Everyone else is surprised
- Teras rages, attacks the maggot twice (hit, miss) and auras (fail)

Rd 3
- Talbot misty steps away and attacks the one previously grappling him (hit)
- Teras is grappled, so he only attacks the buggy (hit, hit)

- Zefir produces flame (NAT 20/kill)
- Genia [[eldritch-blast\|eldritch-blast]]s the one attacking Sky (NAT 20, miss)
- Viri shoots with her longbow (hit/kill)

We investigate. Genia finds a bound tome in dwarvish - the diary of the mine warden. Meanwhile, Talbot harvests the venom sacs from the [[carrion-crawler\|carrion-crawler]]s. Scarlet finds some skeletons in the beds, as well as a [[potion-of-greater-healing\|potion-of-greater-healing]].

Genia flips to the last entry, which makes note of a Chief Magistrate Lancaster who was due to visit in a few days to take stock of the new ketramine discovery to asses it for it's utility and value. 

Teras and Talbot go to investigate the back part of the office. Teras sees a chest sticking out of the dirt and goes to pick it up. Surprise! Roll initiative.

Rd 3
- Genia [[eldritch-blast\|eldritch-blast]]s the mimic (hit/kill)

We decide to move on and look for the soldiers and staff. Zefir sees an odd cut in the wall down the one hallway we haven't explored yet. It looks like some sort of rock door. Zefir casts [[find-traps\|find-traps]] and does not sense any trap. We open the door and find a small chest full of gold.

NOW we head to the elevator. Genia hears rumbling noises in the rock walls on the passage to the elevator. We hurry and get in the elevator. About halfway down, we hear more loud rumbling and cracking and something emerges from the rock to our left. 

A red, scaly creature with starfish arms and an eye in the center of it's body. It starts to yell in a language none of us can understand. It's pointing at different people and trying to communicate something. Scarlet stops the elevator.

It points at things and begins to move away from us. Viri discerns that it's pointing at things and then at it's mouth, Teras' warhammer, Skye's general vicinity, and Scarlet. Teras gives it his tin box, and it shreds it. We are all very confused.

Talbot makes a telepathic connection with the creature. It says "feed metal, help you, mines, know where to go." Talbot relays this to us. Viri offers up her chain shirt and gives it to him. He looks as excited as he can.

We end session cranking down to the next floor.
