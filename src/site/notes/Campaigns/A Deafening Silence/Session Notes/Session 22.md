### Edited Long-Form Notes 

### Raw Notes

We are in Count Henn von Himm's manor in the Cape. Stone walls, shag maroon carpet, a couch, two large red drapes with golden wave embroidered on it.

The arcane energy of the teleportation circle seemed altered by the strange cigarette man somehow. 

Genia opens the door to an empty black void. The Earl says we're in an extradimensional space, and we just have to wait to be collected. 

Viri asks how she'll find the Earl, and he says they can meet at Muggsy Suds in the market district around noon.

Teras experiments with the void.

We are shunted back to reality, and a small gnomish man with white gloves opens the door to the hallway. 

"You're not who I was expecting."

Teras points him to the Earl. The attendant notes that the arrival of companions is unexpected. The Earl says Viri is his apprentice, and the rest of us are her friends. The attendant says he'll need to take our names down since we'll be attending the ball later, and also to give us our papers to let us move freely about the city.

City is highly class segregated - we are currently in the Royal Ward, the highest ward. The papers will allow us into the High and Royal wards. We'd likely be stopped without papers. 

Official no-go deities: Lumen (in the city, bc of rivalry with empire)
Thumbs up gods: Repara, Enneagar, Visyz, Brinity, Cyclonis, Kismet, Gensea

We discuss what else we want to do in the Cape (mostly OOC).

Malakius??? A forbidden god in the city, god of pestilence. Talbot knows them because they're a heretical god. Teras knows them, some folks from my old clan made offerings to Malakius (an evil god) in an attempt to keep sickness at bay. 

As we follow the attendant out, Scarlet asks what the ball dress code is. We head out the door and up wooden stairs to a foyer, we all notice a metal wheel with a little box with little pictures (Howl's moving castle door wheel). Any tailor in the highest district should be able to outfit us for a rental for 20-30 gold in appropriate attire. Market district could also do it. We also pass portraits of an elf in gold plate armor with a golden crown and blue gems set into it, labeled Gardon Hardoun. Opposite him is a human woman, long black curly hair in a big dress that flares out, light blues and greens, Gwendalyn Trevail. The king for the past ~9 years, coming to an end shortly as the Trevails and Hardouns rotate king/queenship every ten years.

Scarlet asks Talbot who of the Trevails will be at the ball - Gwendalyn and her son Marcus.

Talbot shows off his papers and intimidates the attendant into not saying anything about what appears on them. Teras tries to sneak a look but is unsuccessful. The attendant leads us further in to register us all, save for Talbot.

His office is labeled "Jeeves." Teras asks again what the dress code for the higher wards is, and Jeeves says there is no formal dress code but we may get stopped more often by the guards. He says he may be able to procure us pins that indicate our friendship to the Count.

Viri hangs back to ask about the house with the snake sigil - Jeeves explains that's the crest of house Trevail.

A guard checks our papers, kinda brushes off most of us but is pretty respectful to Talbot. We make our way through the High District to Talbot's tailor.

On the way, we spot a bulletin board. Post-Mortem Matters (PMM) is seeking assistance liquidating the estate of Dr. Marcus Fowl. City's division of Wayward Souls is seeking teachers willing to work in the orphanage in the dock ward. A new cohort is open at the Royal school of engineers - apply today!

We walk into the store - behind the counter is a half-orc male looking a bit out of place for the area, wearing a white tank and jeans. "Well if it isn't my old friend Almar!"
