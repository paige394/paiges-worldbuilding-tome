### Bulleted Notes

### Edited Long-Form Notes 

### Raw Notes

Jump back in time a bit - Viri is looking for the rest of us. She knows she won't be needed on stage for a few more songs. A stranger approaches her, a youngish mage in formalwear that Viri thinks may be Carn Trevail (cousin of Marcus, nephew of Gwendolyn). He compliments her on her performance, and Viri ends up offering to dance with him. 
They make some small talk, including Viri asking what role Carn plays. He says he is studying at the Xardhosian academy in the center of the continent, near the Empire. "Knowledge is what I serve, although there are also royal duties mixed in there." They flirt for a little, and Viri tries to learn more about Kylian, with little success. Part of the reaosn Carn went into magic was to help get his cousin out of trouble. Carn's specialty is illusion magic.
Viri returns to stage for "Love Also," with the Earl, a lyricless song. Viri hears a collective gasp, and the music cuts as someone begins to yell, "Assassin!"

The rest of us run into the ballroom against the flow of the crowd. Genia and Zephyr are unable to push through the crowd. Viri tells the Earl to get behind her, but can't make much sense of the chaos. We can see a throng of people gathered in a circle at the front of the room, including the Count and Kylian as well as some other members of the royal family. Genia and Zephyr can see some members of the Royal watch trying to keep the crowd calm and keep them from leaving. 

Scarlett realizes she is covered in blood and nabs Teras' jacket, then blends back into the crowd. Talbot misty steps ahead of the crowd and tries to spot his people, Teras pushes through the crowd to get to Viri. Viri can't tell who exactly the attempt was on, but the Count and Kylian both look okay. Kylian has some blood on his armor, and she can see light emanating from the center of the circle.

The Count steps on stage and addresses the room. "Ladies and Gentleman please, the assassin has been slain, and you are all safe. Please exit in an orderly fashion. The Council will inform you all of what has happened when we can better understand the situation."

The Royal Watch step aside, and the crowd seems a bit calmed although still eager to leave. 

Viri asks the Earl is he saw what happened, and he says no, but that we should leave. Teras makes his way towards Viri but tries to see what's happening in the circle, with little success. 

Genia uses the sending stone to the Count - "Hello, Mr. Count. Do you need me to do anything or should we continue our conversation later?" "Later. Remember what I said about beginning relationships with honesty." Genia catches up to me and says we should leave.

Scarlett tries to locate Dianna, but is unsuccessful. Talbot notices that Dane LaMarelli is notably absent. Zephyr follows Genia, and Teras makes it to Viri.

We all meet up, and none of us know shit, so we leave. Genia notices the Count talking to a few members of the Royal Watch, then steps back into the middle of the circle. The Count says some kind of spell, and then a bright flash of blue emanates from the center of the circle and most of the people in the circle vanish, including the Count.

Scarlet is unsuccessful in locating Dianna. We all meet back up. Genia tells us about her conversation with the Count, and that he specifically wants to be kept aware of our group's moves.

She says she's going to tell the Count that when she arrived in the lounge, Mr. Berr was going crazy and that the glass golems were already broken and an item stolen. 

Viri tells us that she talked to Carn Trevail, and that he's an illusionist, which Viri thinks was strange. She also says that as Kylian walked away, he reacted a bit to a name from his past. 

Scarlet and Talbot split off and head to the Haroun household. Talbot tells her that Yenna will be blunt and straight to the point. As they approach, Talbot notices guards much farther out than normal. The guards stop them at the gate, but when Talbot gives his name the guard says they will check. Scarlet asks if Yenna knows what the artefact is, or if she just knows it's powerful and doesn't want the Count to have it. Talbot says most likely the latter.

They are lead inside to wait for Yenna. Talbot asks Scarlet how she is feeling, and she says she's been better. He also apologizes for not doing more damage before she fell. He "would have hated to see a negative fate befall her."

Yenna exasperatedly calls them in to her office, and they enter. The room is completely dark, Yenna standing and facing a window overlooking the bay. As they walk in, Yenna asks who Talbot's friend is, and Scarlet sees the body of Dianna on the floor. She heads towards it while Talbot answers her question, Scarlet was hired by Yenna, but she wanted to ensure that the artefact was in safe hands. 

Dianna is laying in a pool of blood with no pulse. Yenna says that Scarlett need not worry about the use of the artefact as the one that was stolen was a decoy. Scarlett asks why she killed Dianna. Yenna says she does not tolerate failure, and Scarlet retorts that it seems like Yenna's failure to be subtle enough. 

Yenna implies that Dianna's death is also somewhat of an apology to the Count, probably intending to blame it on Dianna solely. She dismisses Talbot for a while, and asks if he can conspicuously dispose of Dianna's corpse.

Scarlet takes the decoy from Talbot, but she can tell it's not magical. As they leave, Scarlet asks if this is a typical task from Yenna. Talbot says not typical, but it has happened before. They talk about Talbot's satisfaction with his employment, and whether he actually believes in Yenna's cause. She points out that she used to serve people who claimed to better their home but were truly only acting in the interest of their own power. 

Back at the inn, Teras asks Viri if she's okay. Viri asks if she ever told us how she knows Kylian. She says they were looking for an artefact that belonged to some ancient musician and was said to increase your musical prowess. They tracked it to the mountains, and there was a fort that they entered with a coffin they thought the artefact might be in, but when they opened it they were pulled through to here. She wonders if Kylian and her weren't "dropped off" at the same time, and maybe he's been here longer than her. She also says the Sphinx told her that her helping us will prevent something bad from happening back in her home world. 

Teras asks if she thinks she was chosen, and she says Kylian was once so maybe it's history repeating itself. He asks who Kylian is to her. She says that when she was a kid, she was taken by some bad people. They would experiment on her and put her through different tests to see how she would react. She doesn't remember her life before this, but she does remember that Kylian came to save her. And now she's stuck with him for so long that he feels like family. 

As she talks, Viri recalls the story Kylian told her about making a deal with a god to give him a second chance at life, and she realizes that the names of gods she has heard around here are not any gods she has ever heard of before. 

Viri asks if we know any god of justice, and Sky says Visyx. She says she can't believe she's turning to the gods, but Visyx might be sympathetic to who Kylian is as a person and maybe she can get answers from the gods. There is a shrine to Visyx in the Royal Watch headquarters. 

Scarlett and Talbot arrive back at the inn. We eat and then crowd into Scarlett's room, and Scarlett gives us the quick and dirty of what happened, including that Dianna was killed. We discuss our situation, including what Genia is getting from this deal with a Count, and how we will proceed. 

Scarlet hands the hilt to Teras. We are going to try and pass it off as a valuable artefact to make up part of our 1,000gp.

Teras pulls Viri aside to tell her that she doesn't need some artefact, she's already the greatest bard that's ever lived. Then he goes to the roof to sleep under the stars. Genia finds a package inside her otherwise empty room with a note that says "Dearest Genia, Your friend." Inside is a metallic suit of armor, black with little lines of bright green that streak throughout it. It's magic!!! 

Genia attunes to it, and as she does, there is a brief knock on her windowsill. She sees a crow standing outside of her window, pecking as if to come in. Genia opens the window for the crow to come in, and then the Count's voice comes out of the crow.

"Good evening Genia, may I enter?" Genia asks if it is the Count or a bird, and he says he is speaking through a friend of his.

"I sincerely apologize for how the evening concluded. It was terrible and I'm sorry you had to witness it. We will come back stronger than ever." Genia asks what happened, and he says there was an assassination attempt but the Council will be making an announcement with more details later. She asks if the assassination was successful, and the Count implies that it was.  She asks if he thinks this is connected to Vincent in any way. He says there's no evidence to suggest it, but they also do not have evidence to rule it out.

The Count asks about the situation in the lounge. Genia says that something was up with Mr. Berr (the Count says the assault on the lumber factory provided a convenient excuse to rid him of his duties), and her friends noticed something was strange and that he'd let himself into the Count's lounge. We followed him and there was some sort of altercation, but by the time Genia arrived his security had been shattered and the room was in disarray as if something was taken or someone was looking for something. Genia couldn't investigate much more because then the assassination attempt began.

The Count asks if she is certain that it was Mr. Berr whose actions started the brawl. She says no, but that her friends called for help and that he was definitely involved in some way. He says that many great relationships were built on partial truths, and that he can work with this. 

Genia asks if he wants any help getting the item back. He says no, but he's disappointed that those who are trying to save the world would steal from an upstanding citizen of Cape Lamar rather than ask for what they needed. He says he understands why Genia doesn't trust him yet, but that he knows the significance of the item that was stolen from him, and as a gesture of good faith if our group needs the item to advance the ends that we share, he will happily give it to us. We can report to his residence tomorrow and he will give us the blade. She says that's very kind, but she needs him to know that we didn't steal from him. There are others out there who are interested in the item.

He says he will give us assistance in searching for these artefacts, but that's why he needs to know of our whereabouts. She says she's having a hard time understanding his motivations - if he really is so noble, that's great, but she knows that many people in the city are not that way and she doesn't trust him yet.

She tells him that she will plan to see him tomorrow. He says the hilt will be a show of good faith, but that he will also give her some information about the mayor to show his usefulness. He's aware of her presence here in Cape Lamar, and he's sent a group of well-trained soldiers to capture her and take her back to Thistleton. He's expecting that the Count will invite her to meet tomorrow evening at a private room in the casino. He says she needs to arrive at the meeting to keep up appearances, but that she can come well-prepared now.

On the way back to his apartment, Talbot receives a message from the curator, saying he's discovered how the music box works, but is interrupted and seemingly killed. 

We all hear town criers move through the city, announcing the assassination of King Gardon by agents of the Empire, and the Council is declaring war. They announce a draft.
