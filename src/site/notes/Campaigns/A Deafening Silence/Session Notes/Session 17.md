### Bulleted Notes
- Combat!
- Two guards are on our side, the remaining four attack the party and friendly guards.
- Before Jensen is knocked out by Viri, he was fiddling with something unkown.
- Sky [[spare-the-dying\|spare-the-dying]]s Jensen for questioning later. The other three hostile guards are killed.
- Jensen has a letter from Mr. Berr saying that folks from the Cape are investigating and to clear things up. He also has a sending stone.
- Talbot attempts to send "mission accomplished," but the stone has already been used.
- The party takes Jensen back to the Lawkeeper building and stop in to talk to Seb.
- We interrogate Jensen, and Talbot promises his "colleagues won't harm you" in exchange for information.
- "The group" is much larger than just those in Wheaton, including Adam Moresec and other folks along the trade route from Cape Lamar to Thistleton. Their goal is to make money and get rid of "problematic" individuals.
- There was a scheme for insurance fraud where “bandits” “steal” the merchant’s wears and the Lawkeeper would speak for the theft.
- Sky tries to placebo heal Jensen, which aggravates him and he lashes out. The group kills him.
- Zephyr finds an entrance to the tunnels in the Lawkeeper basement.

### Edited Long-Form Notes 
Absent: Paige|Teras


Take Jensen back to Seb’s office at the lawkeeper’s place

Mink and Gorlac start to patch themselves up back at the lawkeeper’s place. Sky starts on a healing spell while the rest talk to Seb

Seb plans to go to the druid camp to check up on them since Berr doesn’t care about them.

We head down to the barracks to revive Jensen

Jensen wants a guarantee of safety for information. Jensen wants to maintain the security of the larger operation, that’s much more than what we have in wheaton. The group involves Adam Morsek and other folks along the trade route from cape lamar to thistleton. The group wants to make money and get rid of problematic individuals. There was a scheme for insurance fraud where “bandits” “steal” the merchant’s wears and the lawkeeper would speak for the theft. Sometimes the merchants would lose a member and dispose of the body along the road with headstones and proper funerals.

Sky tries to placebo heal Jensen, he doesn’t believe it, so Sky whacks him with their staff, Jensen shoots his fire breath, and the rest of the group destroys Jensen. Zephyr notices a small crack in the wall in the barracks like there’s a secret door. Zephyr pushes it open and finds an entrance to the tunnels

Talbot teleports out of the room

### Raw Notes
From Alex:

Combat!

Two of the guards are attacking their own (Gorlac, Mink), 4 are attacking us

Sky gets focused by 2 of the guards upstairs and tries to catch two in a hold person, but only gets one

Brown Bear!Zephyr knocks down a bad guy

One of the guards (6) takes down another of them (2)

One of the guards shoots a cone of fire at viri and scarlet. Viri rebukes him

Talbot knocks down Marcy

Genia fucking withers a man to a husk with inflict wounds (crit from full to 0)

Viri shoots an eldritch blast to Jensen and kills him. Before Jensen’s death, he was fiddling with something first

Gorlac kills Marcy

Sky spares Jensen’s life with spare the dying for further discussions. On his body is the letter from Berr that folks from the Cape are investigating and to clear things up. Jensen’s got a sending stone on his person. Talbot tries to send mission accomplished, but can’t because it was already used in the day
