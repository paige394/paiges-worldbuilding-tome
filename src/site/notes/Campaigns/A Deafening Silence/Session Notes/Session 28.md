### Edited Long-Form Notes 

### Raw Notes
We discuss pie eating strategy and then head to the contest. Peach, raspberry, apple, and peanut butter are the pie options. Magic encouraged, no harm or assault permitted, if you hurl you're out. 

A well-dressed man speaking into a stone-like item (microphone) announced the competition. This is the Count (that the Earl is staying with).

Teras suffers a humiliating defeat. Scarlet finishes second and qualifies for the real contest.

We head back to Muggsy Suds to discuss. Talbot tells us about the planned cultist attack and asks us to keep an eye out. Genia and Teras are planning to check out the exotic ingredients job, while Scarlet rests and everyone else heads to the Dock Ward to be on cult watch. A small gnomish man enters, and Viri recognizes him as the man being attacked by thugs the other night. He approaches our table and tells Viri he's changed his mind and would like some help. He tells us he is indebted to someone, and he would like to hire us to beat them up tomorrow night. The mob boss is Mr. Grey, with whom Talbot is vaguely familiar. 

Viri agrees to kill his debtors for 100gp. Teras and Genia agree to come along. 

Viri asks Talbot about House Trevail to try and get more info on Kylian. She learns the Trevails are more magically inclined, and perhaps that is why Kylian was branded, and Talbot promises to keep an eye out. Talbot notices a suspicious group of people milling outside a store - Geronimo's Toys & Trinkets. There are some officials making their way inside and the store is blocked off. It sounds like someone died inside the store. Talbot flashes his credentials and leads he and Viri inside. Someone has definitely been murdered, and officials are inside collecting evidence. 

The official says they don't need any "interference" from the Noble houses, but tells Talbot what happened. The coroner says it was a heart attack, but the man's eyes were burned out of his sockets. Talbot remarks that that is rather unusual, and the official goes off that it may be an illegal drug that the Nobility could be doing more to keep off the streets.

At the very end of session, Talbot spies a music box on his desk.
