### Bulleted Notes
- Teras identifies the attackers as thri-kreen and is able to harvest some of their poison; he gives a vial to Scarlet, Viri, and Genia
- Sky sees a familiar statue a bit away from our camp 
- They go to investigate with Viri, and are able to read the plaque in Celestial which says "Home of the sun and stars, even when I seem gone, I am never far."
- Bert has never seen these statues before, but doesn't seem worried by their presence
- During their watch, Sky and Genia see a pair of bobbing white lights heading towards our camp; they don't think whatever it is will arrive until morning, so they let everyone keep resting 
- Immediately after we wake up, a band of four mercenaries ride into camp asking us to hand over Genia as she's wanted for murder; they tell her that the mayor sends his regards
- Teras initiates combat, and the party wipes the board with the four blades for hire 
- Genia explains that she and Teras are wanted for murder, but they were completely justified in their actions 
- Scarlet says she thought the mercenaries were coming for her, so she can't really point fingers 
- Further conversation is interrupted by a revenant Lightkeeper (Janeus) arriving to take his revenge against Scarlet 
- Teras also seems to recognize the Lightkeeper
- Janeus nearly kills Scarlet several times, but the party rallies around her and is able to dispatch him fairly quickly 
- We are unfortunately not powerful enough to kill his soul yet, so it escapes to find another body and come back for Scarlet at a later date
- Scarlet reveals that Janeus killed Tiri's parents, and she killed him to protect Tiri 
- Teras reveals that Janeus killed his mother then captured him and sold him to Baxter, who forced him to fight in the gladiator circuit in the north
- On the final stretch to Wheaton, Scarlet and Teras come to the conclusion that this group is likely stuck together for a while, and maybe that's not such a bad thing as they all seem to be wanted for one reason or another 
- Zephyr reveals that she is from Wheaton and "didn't leave on good terms"
- Teras asks the group if they are okay being seen traveling with him since he is very easy to recognize; they all affirm they aren't gonna leave him and "we're a pretty recognizable bunch anyways"
- As we approach, we can see Wheaton is crawling with guards; they stop us for a checkpoint as we try to enter the town

### Edited Long-Form Notes 
Teras attempts to appraise the bug creatures and harvest any useful parts. He is able to identify them as thri-kreen, and harvests 3x thri-kreen mandible poison and 1x thri-kreen carapace.

> Thri-Kreen Poison: Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition, or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also paralyzed while poisoned this way. The poisoned target can repeat the saving throw on each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
> Thri-Kreen Carapace: Can be taken to a blacksmith and turned into armor.

Teras gives a vial to Scarlet, Viri, and Genia. 

Sky can see a similar statue to the one we previously saw just over the hill. They decide to investigate, and Viri follows.

Viri is pretty sure this is the exact same statue she saw yesterday. Sky can read the plaque in Celestial: "Home of the sun and stars, even when I seem gone, I am never far." They walk the perimeter of the statue to investigate further. They notice the force field, but nothing else. Viri shares that this is Blazein, and Sky suggests they could set it on fire.

They head back to camp. Sky asks Bert if those statues are common, to which he says he's never seen them in his life. Viri asks if he knows who Blazein is, and he said he does but it's not odd that there's a statue of the desert goddess in the desert. The last time he passed through here was last summer, and he doesn't remember seeing them then.

Aoife and Teras take first watch. The sands buffet them both while everyone else is safe inside a tent. Nothing remarkable happens.

Genia and Sky take second watch. Against the dark of the night sky, Sky can see two glowing balls of white light a few miles away bobbing up and down. Sky can tell that they are a set of eyes, approaching us from the northeast (not along the main road). They cannot tell how fast it is traveling.

Genia ("taking her copium") says it's probably a fellow traveler. As they watch it a while longer, they think it will take until dawn to get to them. It dips up and down behind dunes as it approaches, and it seems like it could be heading right toward us or just generally towards the road.

As we begin to rouse, a pair of horses with two large riders crest over a hill a few thousand feet away. Two more ride behind them, four in total riding along the road towards us. Genia can tell they are very well-armed, and seem like rough and tumble individuals. 

Genia suggests waking everyone up and trying to flee to avoid them. They are 800 ft. away. Bert tells us to "Pack up and get ready for a fight, this is what I paid you for."

Teras tries to set up a rope to trip the horses, but the bandits definitely see him. Seeing he is caught, he stands in the middle of the road ready to chop at the riders if they run past. Viri tried to help with the rope, so stands next to Teras when he prepares. 

Everyone else begins to prepare for battle. Genia and Sky helpfully tell the rest of the party about the glowing lights they saw and ask Bert if he knows any glowing lights in the desert. He says he does not and they're "all the more reason to get the fuck out of here."

The riders slow as they approach, and Aoife and Teras can see patches on their overcoats, two crossed daggers that indicate a mercenary guild.

"Good morning, nice to see some early risers around here." The leader stops and gets off his horse.

Teras greets them.

"You've got a murderer in your midst. If you hand her over we'll be on our way." The mercenary points straight towards Genia.

Scarlet asks under what authority he thinks he can be "snatching women out of the desert." Teras tells them to move along. 

The mercenary asserts that he'll move along when he gets the girl, and that he acts under the authority of common law. "When you murder someone, you die!"

Teras, enraged, charges.

Roll initiative. 

Round 1
- Scarlet pulls out her crossbow and fires at a mercenary on horseback (miss)
- Zephyr pulls out her crossbow and fires at another rider (hit, crit)
- Genia pisses her pants, and casts [[expeditious-retreat\|expeditious-retreat]] on Scarlet, pleading that she will explain but just don't let them kill her; she uses her action to cast [[eldritch-blast\|eldritch-blast]] (hit, crit)
- Viri "Why does it always have to be the fucking police?" She casts shatter in the middle of the group to try and startle the horses to buck their riders, (pass, fail, fail/kill, fail) one rider falls prone and one manages to land on his feet, all four horses die; she gives Teras bardic inspiration "Show them why they call you monster."
- The one knocked prone uses his crossbow on Viri (hit), the other swings at Viri with his mace (hit, hit) who hellish rebuke's (fail, kill), the final takes a shot at Genia (miss)
- Aoife fires her crossbow (hit)
- Sky casts [[cure-wounds\|cure-wounds]] on Viri and tells the final mercenary they can run and we'll let them go
- Teras apparently does not agree, so he rages, runs up to the final mercenary, and chops him in half with his battleaxe (hit, kill)

Scarlet asks Genia for an explanation, and she tells her that she and Teras are wanted for murder. Scarlet asks if we are murderers, to which Teras slams his axe into the dead mercenary that fired at Genia and says, "Not our fault."

Genia says technically yes, but it was justified and they deserved it, unfortunately no one else saw it that way.

Scarlet confesses, "Well actually, I thought they were here for me...so it seems we've all made some bad choices."

With perfect timing, a decaying rider in shining golden armor on a skeletal black horse crests the hill, screaming "SCAAAAARLET!"

Scarlet recognizes the man as Janeus. "Oops, I guess that one's for me." She can tell that he is a revenant, which means two things: he regenerates health unless hit with fire or radiant damage, and once this body is destroyed the soul will simply find a new body and continue hunting his target.

Teras recognizes the face, a man with a nose nearly broken clean off. He screams, "HE'S MINE!"

Same initiative, Teras keeps his rage.

Round 2
- Scarlet invokes a radiant blood rite and fires her crossbow at Janeus (hit)
- Zephyr hurls a [[produce-flame\|produce-flame]] at him (hit)
- Genia swings her sword with a [[green-flame-blade-tce\|green-flame-blade-tce]] at the horse (hit) and jumps the flame to Janeus (hit)
- Janeus tells Genia to get out of the way, and rushes past (OA eldritch blast, hit); he swings at Scarlet with his greatsword (miss, hit)
- Viri casts [[heroism\|heroism]] on Scarlet and gives her a bardic inspiration, "Hang in there girl, you got this!"
- Aoife (absent) uses her crossbow (miss)
- Sky casts [[shillelagh\|shillelagh]] on their staff, and casts [[bless\|bless]] on Scarlet, Teras, and Zephyr
- Teras runs up to Janeus and uses his lightning aura (pass), and swings with his battleaxe (reckless, great weapon master; hit)

Round 3
- Scarlet strikes at him with her rapier (hit on AC) 
- Zephyr pulls out her crossbow and fires (miss) and casts [[shillelagh\|shillelagh]] on her staff 
- Genia drops [[expeditious-retreat\|expeditious-retreat]] and casts [[ray-of-enfeeblement\|ray-of-enfeeblement]] (hit)
- Janeus screams "Traitor!" at Scarlet and swings with his greatsword (hit) and then "You will pay!" and swings again (miss); Scarlet says "You're the one who paid for your crimes."
- Viri casts [[healing-word\|healing-word]] on Scarlet and casts [[thunderwave\|thunderwave]] which hits Janeus, the horse, and Genia (fail, fail/kill, pass); Janeus was surrounded and cannot be pushed away
- Aoife (absent) fires her crossbow (miss)
- Sky tells Scarlet "Looks like you're the one he wants to kill," and casts [[shield-of-faith\|shield-of-faith]], dropping [[bless\|bless]]; they also channel divinity and blast 20 hit points into her 
- Teras uses his lightning aura (fail) and swings his greataxe (reckless, great weapon master; hit)

Round 3
- Scarlet strikes with her rapier (hit)
- Zephyr pulls out her crossbow and fires (miss)
- Genia swings with her sword (hit on AC)
- Janeus yells, "You have forsaken your post!" and swings at Scarlet with his greatsword (hit, miss)
- Viri swings with her shortsword (miss) and gives Sky a bardic inspiration 
- Aoife (absent) fires her crossbow (miss)
- Sky smacks at him with their staff (NAT1) but smacks Viri in the face instead 
- Teras uses hit lightning aura (hit, kill)

Teras cleaves his head clean off his body, which rolls off to land face up the dirt, the smashed nose pointed straight up at him.

Scarlet succeeds on a history check that tells her if she does radiant damage before his next turn, this body will die. Otherwise, he would regenerate some hit points on his turn. She pierces his heart with her rapier and he (head included) explodes into dust. A small wisp, similar to the drow, raises up out of the dust cloud and shoots straight upwards.

Teras screams at the place where the head was and looks around, frenzied, until he sees the armor remaining on the ground. He swings at it recklessly, working himself into more of a frenzy, until Genia comes and puts a hand on his shoulder. He turns to her, looking terrified, and says "I think we need to talk."

Sky asks what that was, and Scarlet tells them he was a revenant, apparently with his sights set on her. Genia asks how Scarlet knows him. She said they had a run-in, he was the one who killed Tiri's parents and she killed him trying to protect Tiri.

Teras says, "Since we're sharing, he killed my mother." He tells her that he also captured Teras and sold him to a man named Baxter to fight in the arena circuit. 

Bert calls out to ask if it's safe to come out, to which Teras calls out "NO!" 

Scarlet recognizes the fighting circuit. She asks him if there were any more, to which he says yes but he only remembers Janeus' face. "I was the one who broke his nose, I definitely remember that face."

Sky deals out some [[goodberry\|goodberry]] while Genia and Teras loot the cultists. We find 24gp and 18sp.

Teras asks Scarlet if she's gonna kill him since she's a Lightkeeper, and she says that "even when she was, she really wasn't." Scarlet says it seems like they're stuck together and Teras offers up that there is strength in numbers. 

As they approach Wheaton, Zephyr announces that this is her hometown and she didn't exactly leave on the best of terms, so she will be going into cat mode. (Maysa leaves).

Teras laughs, "We're a real fucked up bunch ain't we? Sky, who did you kill then?" They chuckle nervously, "Well it seems like I'm the only one who hasn't! I'm a healer, not a killer!"

As we crest the hill, we can see that this town is crawling with guards. Teras can see as we exit the end of the desert, four sets of horse tracks heading to the North, off the main road. 

Teras asks the group if they're sure they want to head into town with them as he is pretty recognizable. Everyone asserts that they're not leaving him behind and they are a weird group anyways. 

Genia asks if anyone else has business in town, and Viri says they are here to see The Earl. Genia and Teras have no idea who that is, which Bert reacts to incredulously. He says "He's got the coolest shit going on! Way better than whatever shit she's got going on," and points at Viri. Teras threateningly asks if he wants to amend his statement. Small talk continues about The Earl. 

Genia asks if Viri wants to ask anyone about her friend, which she says she probably should.

Sky asks if Rentlam Forest is near here, as they should probably look for more of the magic weapons. Genia asks for more info, and Sky tells them about Mordresh and The Seven and the weapons.

As we approach, a guard near the town entrance holds out their hand to stop us for a checkpoint. Viri tries to high five it, but Teras stops her.

Fin.

### Raw Notes 
Teras attempts to appraise and harvest from the bug creatures.

They are thri-kreen. Teras gets 3x thri-kreen mandible poison and 1x carapace.

Genia says technically yes, but it was justified and they deserved it, unfortunately no one else saw it that way.

Scarlet confesses, "Well actually, I thought they were here for me...so it seems we've all made some bad choices."

With perfect timing, a decaying rider in shining golden armor on a skeletal black horse crests the hill, screaming "SCAAAAARLET!"

Teras cleaves his head clean off his body, which rolls off to land face up the dirt, the nose pointed straight up at him.

Scarlet succeeds on a history check that tells her if she does radiant damage before his next turn, he will truly die. She pierces his heart with her rapier and he (head included) explodes into dust. A small wisp, similar to the drow, raises up out of the dust cloud and shoots straight upwards.

Teras screams at the place where the head was and looks around, frenzied, until he sees the armor remaining on the ground. He swings at it recklessly, working himself into more of a frenzy, until Genia comes and puts a soft hand on his shoulder. He turns to her, looking terrified and with tears in his eyes, and says "I think we need to talk."

Sky asks what that was, Scarlet divulges what it is.

Genia asks how Scarlet knows him. She said they had a run-in, he was the one who killed Tiri's parents and she killed him trying to protect Tiri.

Bert calls out to ask if it's safe to come out, to which Teras calls out "NO!" 

Scarlet recognizes the fighting circuit, and that monsters shouldn't be sold into the arena, especially by Lightkeepers. She asks him if there were any more, to which he says yes but he only remembers Janeus.

Sky deals out some [[goodberry\|goodberry]] while Genia and Teras loot the cultists. We find 24gp and 18sp.

As they approach Wheaton, Zephyr announces that this is her hometown and she didn't exactly leave on the best of terms, so she will be going into cat mode. (Maysa leaves).

Teras laughs, "We're a real fucked up bunch ain't we? Sky who did you kill?" They chuckle nervously, "Well it seems like I'm the only one who hasn't! I'm a healer, not a killer!"
