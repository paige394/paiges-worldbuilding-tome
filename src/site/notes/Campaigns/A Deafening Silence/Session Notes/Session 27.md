### Bulleted Notes

### Edited Long-Form Notes 

### Raw Notes
Teras pays for our rooms through the 5th. 

Talbot tells us he's investigating the Cult of Kai-Teren "Heralds of the Dusk," a doomsday cult intent upon wreaking havoc in the city. He asks if we have ever had dealings with them. We tell him we ran into some of them in Bartholomew and they tried to capture a prominent druid. 

Talbot tries to make a joke about the cultists being stinky. It doesn't land. He says they are causing problems around the city though. They have recovered a document in a strange dialect (Celestial). Neither of our celestial speakers can decipher it at a quick glance.

Sky and Zephyr decipher over dinner: I have (blank) the cloak (blank). (blank) provides our opportunity (blank) the fortnight (blank) the Heralds for (blank) and meet on the (blank) origin.

All of us head to the Dock Ward, most of us heading to the Laughing Monkey, Genia going to the alley behind Geronimo's Toy's & Trinkets. The tavern crowd is rowdy, but Sky and Zephyr focus on decoding more of the note.

Genia makes her way to the alley. Waiting for about 10 minutes, a cloaked figure comes from the other end of the alley and approach. It's Kendra. 

Kendra says, 'You came. You are committed to be here.' Genia says "Committed to what?" Kendra: That vengeance is the best form of justice. Genia: Are you going to help me? K: I'm going to ask you to help me. Well, really, to help the world. To make it a better, safer place for some of the most vulnerable. In return, I will help you in whatever endeavors it is you have planned. G: Okay, let's go. K: Are you familiar with a man named Vincent Hayes? (She hands Genia a flyer, a older, handsome gentleman with a slim face, short haircut, bushy beard, reads 'Vincent Hayes, Saviour of the People') He paints himself as a champion of the lower classes, the vulnerbale, the poor, the downtrodden. He uses the funds he raises from providing his healing services to the wealthy to fun the city's orphanage. G: You're making him sound like a pretty nice guy. K: That is the image we are all supposed to buy into. He is not the hero he is made out to be. Last year, I was investigating the disappearance of Jamie, a 12-yo elven girl at the city's orphanage.  

Jamie just up and left, which isn't always unusual in and of itself for an orphanage, but Kendra figured she'd look into it. The disappearances at the orphanage weren't so random - one disappearance within the week of each solstice going back years. Most kids didn't seem concerned, but Mason (her best friend), said the night that she disappeared, someone came into their room and woke Jamie up and took her somewhere. Kendra thinks it may be something nefarious, so she keeps investigating. Tobias has a similar story about his friend Daniel, who disappeared the summer before. One night I went searching the orphanage to see if I could find anything, and I did. There was a supposedly abandoned basement under the orphanage, but there was a passageway down there, and when I looked around I found signs of torture and sacrifice. Kendra told her superiors and they organized a raid, but the secret passageway was gone. It is not too late for justice to prevail.

Genia asks how she knows it was Vincent, and Kendra says that in the chamber she found the evidence in had notes and writings that match the handwriting and tone of Vincent. Kendra asks what Genia is going to do about it. She pulls out a vial with a syringe and gives it to Genia, explaining that the liquid will make it look a natural death, so long as there is no evidence of a struggle surrounding the victim. Vincent's house is a few blocks away in the dock ward. 

Genia asks why her, and Kendra says she has reasons to trust her, but not others. Kendra also warns her that Vincent may derive power from his experiments, so healing may not be all he can do.

Kendra's face has morphed into that of Genia's old lady, 'Make sure he sees it, make sure he suffers.' 

The rest of the celestial message reads: I have located the Cloak of Kaizen, distraction provides our opportunity upon the fortnight. Muster the Heralds for infiltration, and meet on the month's origin.

Sky overheard someone say that the execution of this cult member was public knowledge, and so the other members of the cult likely heard of it and may not be going to the meeting anymore. 

Genia heads to the house of Vincent. There are a few people about, but it's fairly quiet for this time of night. There are lights on in the house, and a sign welcoming everyone in. She decides to head back to the tavern.

We all meet up and discuss some things we could do over the next few days, including odd jobs on the boards and going to the library to look into the artifacts of the seven. Zephyr notices several groups of people emerge from the basement just before we get ready to leave. 

We head back to Muggsy Suds, and Teras tries the gauntlets on after Sky says they don't have any magic that could find out what they are. Teras gets the sense that he needs to attune to them, so he does. Everyone else plays cards.

Pie plan: Zephyr, Teras, and Viri will enter. Viri will smoke some weed, Sky has something that can boost Teras and Zephyr, and Genia will cast haste on Teras.
