### Bulleted Notes

### Edited Long-Form Notes 

### Raw Notes

Teras wins his fight against Jorge, pinning him through the shoulder with his horn in hopes of doing permanent damage. Afterwards, he asks Talbot how he knows he's doing the right thing, two which Talbot says he doesn't always. But he thinks that if you are doing something for the benefit of the most people, it is probably good.

Teras turns back and gives the money he doesn't need for Genia's mob debt to the fight coordinator to give to Jorge. They head back upstairs and Teras gives Genia 270gp, leaving him penniless. 

Skye and Talbot head to the library to do some research. Skye doesn't learn much new information. Talbot learns that a few weeks before the mine was abandoned, there were reports of ketramine deposits, a rare and valuable substance used in teleportation magic. "The queen of many faces," was a phrase being repeated nonsensically by the few miners that were recovered after the incident.

The rest of us go to see the count. Jeeves meets us at the door and tells us the Count is regrettably busy with matters of war, but he has left the hilt for us to collect. He brings it out, and Jeeves says the Count presents it as a token of his friendship. If we need a wagon and a driver for our future endeavors, the Count is also willing to provide one. 

Scarlet touches the hilt of the sword and feels a little tingle.

We leave and Teras immediately asks Scarlet if she's going to connect the sword halves and if she thinks it will explode. She says she's not sure, but she is going to try and connect them. We are all blinded by a radiant burst, and then we hear armored footsteps. "I am Tajeck Senvalora first of his name, Champion of the Senvalorum, Slayer of the Wicked, and Keeper of the Sword."

Teras rushes the voice, and we roll initiative. Tajeck swings at Teras and hits once, saying "Die, evil!" Genia asks him why he thinks we are evil, and he says it's because we charged him. Teras says it's because he thought they were breaking into our room. Tajeck says he will not swing again if we lay down our weapons and prove ourselves allies to his cause. 

We surrender. Teras regains his sight. I can see three knights with swords and shields in battle stances, prepared to fight. The insignia on their shields is not anything I recognize. Teras asks how they got in there.

"We are servants of Premita, protectors of the meek and downtrodden, and keepers of the sword."

"We are the keepers of the sword, tasked to guard it for eternity. We have been summoned by the sword to protect it against those who would use it. It's time is past." Tajeck begins to cast a spell, and there is now a yellowish-orangish circle surrounding us all.

Everyone but Genia regains their sight. Scarlet tells them we have no intentions of using the sword, we just had the two halves and put it together. Scarlet and Teras fail their saves and cannot lie.

The sword in Tajek's hand looks exactly like the sword we just reassembled, even though the physical one is still laying on the bed. Tajek insists that we must give up the sword and give up on our quest. We try to insist that we need it to defeat Mordresh, and he has been unleashed. Tajek refuses to believe us, and says we must destroy the sword or die. We psychic message Talbot for help as Tajek turns nasty.

Skye knows Premita is a celestial word for, roughly, "the meek, the downtrodden," but not the name of any god they're familiar with.

Zephyr goes to "fetch our friends" but just stands outside. We continue to try to convince Tajek to let us keep the items, pretty unsuccessfully.
