### Raw Notes
Talbot Envers - Colin's Character - PI-type from Cape Lamar, a "fixer" for the elites of Cape Lamar, winter eladrin, rogue

Two ghost kids playing hopscotch in the center of the room with a semi-ghost-looking Dwarven person (Kerric) with big boxing gloves. Body in one corner (charred remains of a third child). Glowing flashing purple runes carved into the pillars in the room. We can hear the sound of rushing water beyond the far wall. Genia tried to play hopscotch but failed, Kerric tried to claim Viri's lute but she refused to give it up, initiating combat.
