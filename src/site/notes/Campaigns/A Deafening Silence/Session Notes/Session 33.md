### Edited Long-Form Notes 

### Raw Notes
We are instructed to head downstairs where a green-skinned, white-haired woman tells us to 'be little doves and make it easy' and then points to a set of chains. Genia asks why.

"Tabitha, you said Reginald sent these?" Tabitha confirms to Gwenyth, who says "I see they've chosen the difficult option."

Tabitha drops her disguise and becomes a green-skinned, white-haired woman as well.

Investigating the basement - macabre, body parts and blood, and Genia and Zephyr discover a crate with a loud buzzing sound. Teras cuts open the bags upstairs and discovers just flour. The other three bags contain similarly innocuous supplies. Teras goes outside to check the cart, and Genia and Zephyr carry the boxes upstairs (1ft cubes that weigh almost nothing). There is nothing suspicious on the cart, but Teras hears a faint thudding sound coming from the back of the cabin. He gets Genia and Zephyr and investigates a sealed stable. 

Teras calls out "Hello," and the thudding stops. He tries Draconic, Minotaur, and Gnomish to no avail, and then steps aside and opens the door. Inside is a large skeletal warhorse in riding gear. Zephyr and Teras win him over and then we go back to look through the cabin. 

Teras shakes the box - it sounds like a glass bottle rattling around. We pry open the crate - inside is a tall glass jar filled with little weird helicopter seeds in all different colors, almost like thin butterfly wings. Teras recalls hearing about these when he was a child - rumors about magical creatures that lived in the forest and looked like butterflies with human faces, they were pixies. Genia thinks Gwendolyn and Tabitha were hags, and there are rumors of them eating people.

Teras theorizes that they were payment for the hags and someone else would come to pick up the wings. We decide to go back to the inn and pretend like we picked up the delivery no problem. 

We arrive back at the inn and Teras stays outside with the cargo while Genia and Zephyr head back in. The bartender looks extremely confused when Genia says the job is done and says he thought we were going in the morning. Genia offers to show him the package and he says he can do it after last call. The bartender still seems very flustered by the conversation. Zephyr sits at the bar and watches him till last call.

Just before last call, the barkeep heads into the back room and says he "has to take care of something."

Teras hears some faint footsteps in the direction of the stables, at the far end. Then I hear something that sounds like a lock being unlocked. Teras sneaks over there and hears the barkeep whispering something and some movement inside the stable. I can see him getting a horse ready to ride. 

Teras steps out and says, "We're down in the stable you gave us if you want to check out the package." The barkeep starts and says he just had to check on Franny cause she gets nervous. Teras leads him to the package, and after verifying it's the correct shipment he pulls out his coin purse and says "It was fifty right?" Teras tells him it was 100gp, for the trouble. 

We reconnect with our friends and give them a shortened version of the story, and ask Talbot to come speak to the barkeep with us. While they pitch tents, Talbot and Teras head in to speak to the barkeep (Talbot to talk, Teras just to look scary). Talbot tells the barkeep to tell us their involvement with this plot, and rolls incredibly well on intimidation. He tells us the manager's name is Dennis. Talbot gets him to give us the roster of employees, and asks if he knows Reggie. The barkeep says he does not. 

We head back outside and show Viri the ledger in Sylvan, and it appears to be communications with another hag as well as a record of exchanges with Reginald (height, weight, and description of people who showed up as well as the weight of pixie wings paid out).

Viri approaches Teras and asks about the skeletal horse. 

In the morning we go back to the hags' house to look for Bones. He has left, so Viri, Genia, and Zephyr decide to stay behind to look for him a bit more while those of us in events start on the road back home. Genia is able to find Bones at the edge of a pond. Viri doesn't recognize the horse. She tries to disguise herself as Kylian with disguise self, but the horse does not seem to acknowledge her at all.

On the walk back, Viri gets a message from Jeeves asking her to come to rehearsal, and asking her to bring Skye as the Count is inviting them to dinner. We get back to the city and head to the games.

Teras, Scarlet, and 'Lino' are in the athletes' lounge during the earliest competitions. Diana Yvonovich is in the lounge as well, and approaches Scarlet wondering what she's doing here. Scarlet tells her she is here as an obligation to her party to secure another ticket. Diana asks her to meet her at the bathhouse tomorrow morning to finalize arrangements.

Teras places second in the caber toss, winning 100gp. Talbot places second in the steeplechase. 

Each event has had a different noble helping to hand out medals, and for the steeplechase the noble is 'Kylian von Himm.'
