### Bulleted Notes

### Edited Long-Form Notes 

### Raw Notes
We arrive in Tunaville. There are farms, mostly on the Western side, and a river on the Eastern side yet. It seems unremarkable, except for an unusual amount of work being done on the outer wall. It seems they are preparing for war.

Skye and Scarlet go looking for a diamond worth 300gp. There is a jeweler in town, but no diamonds on display. Skye inquires with the clerk, and they manage to find a wedding ring with a large diamond set it in. They offer to remove the diamond from the ring and sell it to them for 350gp. 

Genia goes looking for magical ink for her journal. There is a seller in town that has some for 50gp.

We sell various bits and bobs in town for money. Viri tries to con the blacksmith into giving her a breastplate, pretending that she's enlisted. 

Genia runs into her and offers up her forgery kit skills. They both realize they have never seen anything official from the government. Instead they decide to get a regular slip, have Genia alter it to say breastplate required, and then pose as a military official to help Viri get this armor.

She successfully gets her little slip, and tries to observe her new commanding officer. She pivots and watches some duels going on. It seems mostly like drills for people new to fighting. She pretends to study her rapier, and an officer asks her what she's doing and tells her to get in line. She ties with the person she is paired against, and dejectedly tries to sneak away. The commanding officer catches her and tells her to get a proper weapon. 

Genia's forgery does not go well. Viri gives up on the breastplate and gets a longsword instead. Then she disguises herself as a pretty blonde lady and begins to play her lute in the square.

We pool our money to get a 320gp diamond. 

The rest of us gather up, ready to go, and wonder where Viri is. She's trying to con an officer by pretending her father is sick. He offers to bring her some medicinal herbs later, but she says she cannot stay long. She suggests meeting up tonight instead, and he is happy to oblige. She feigns worry for a fake brother who has "terrible armor," and she asks if the officer could procure some more better armor for him. He agrees.

Viri disguises Genia as Dexter, her half-elven brother. They meet up with the officer, who is carrying a chain shirt. She thanks him and they rejoin the group.

We head out of Tunaville and off the road. We discuss the Count - who is he, what are his motivations, how much should we tell him through Genia's sending stone?

As we talk about it, Genia gets a message. "Genia, the wealthy and powerful often find assassins quite useful. I don't know what the mayor used his for."

We settle in for the night. Our watches pass uneventfully, and we wake up refreshed and ready to go.

Twyla recommends stopping for lunch at her friend's house, Vinny. She likes "his goods" (wine).

An old gnomish man with a big white beard greets us. He asks us our names and fixes us a pleasant lunch. Afterwards, he shows us his "trade secret," a Ratatouille-style machinery contraption run on rats. He adopts out a rat to Teras, and two to Zephyr. Teras names his Vincent.

Teras tries to use Ofeus' sending stone but gets no responses.

On our journey in the morning, we see some light smoke about half a mile to the south, the direction of the mountains. We ignore Lockie's blatant plot hook and continue on.

Genia sees another small cloud of smoke to the south the next day. We ask Twyla if it's unusual to see folks out this way, and she says it's not especially common but also not suspicious or alarming to her. 

In the afternoon, Zephyr notices a patch of trees with a large stone wall built into the front of one of the hills. Next to it there are three unattended horses. 

We all head over (except for Twyla) and Zephyr tries to talk to the horses. Carved into the stone door are runic symbols that Teras recognizes. "THE WELL OF FORBIDDEN SECRETS." Beneath it, "The greatest Good is shown,
By giving of your own.
Monstrous Evil then,
To do to other Men.

The first, a thing of beauty,
The second something sour.
Made in Honor, Love and Duty,
Or done in thirst for Power.

The ugly truth is this my friends,
Written cold and plain.
The means may justify the ends,
But that will not numb the pain.
How do you end, whatâ€™s your epitaph?
For answers, will you pay the price?
No one can give on your behalf,
You must make the ..."

Skye makes out a symbol among the runes that is the symbol of some deity, either to Visyx god of Judgment, Kismet god of Luck, or Gensea goddess of knowledge. 

Zephyr finds out the rider's name is Quinn, and she went into the door for something the horse does not know. Quinn has been gone for roughly thirty minutes.

Teras writes the rune for "sacrifice" onto the poem in his blood. We all head into the tunnel, but not before Teras ties a rope off to a tree and leaves it trailing through the door.

We head down a dark staircase. Genia hears the sound of shoes on the staircase ahead of us, and she sees the cactus men from the ball (with the insignia the Visier of Herbone had). Their anatomy has changed significantly, arms and legs moved around. 

One of the attendants moves forward and says in Sylvan, "Greetings, friends." Viri replies hello, and asks where we are. The attendant says it's the Well of Forbidden Secrets. The horses outside are theirs. The Well is an opportunity to gain knowledge, but it comes at a hefty price. The attendant laughs and says the price for entrance is trivial. The Vizier has just made a hefty sacrifice, and they will now be on their way.

Scarlet notices that the Vizier is missing flowers. 

The attendant says that there is a spirit at the bottom of the staircase that will explain. 

We continue down and come to a flat platform surrounded by a cave of some sort. A large stone door with similar runes and the religious symbol carved into it. A blue, brightly illuminated spirit steps forward from the stone. 

"Greetings, travelers. You have come to seek knowledge."

"Each of you must come with your own terms that match the value of the knowledge you seek."

Viri steps forward first, and walks through the door. She exits, seemingly intact.

Teras steps forward next. I enter a similar stone chamber, totally dark. A booming voice whispers out, "Teras, what answers do you seek?"

He asks about his mother. Why were the Lightkeepers in that town, who brought them there, who does he have to face to get justice for her?

He offers up his axe, and when he places it on the floor it dissolves into dust. 

"You know some of those who are responsible for the ambush you faced as a child. Janeus Flutendolf, a captain at the time. Plintus Zinstra, a retired Seargent who currently resides in Whispering Ridge, where she is attempting to rebuild the town after an attack by dark forces. There is Devik Lumen, now the head of the Lightkeeper organization. You may find him residing in the capital city of the Empire, or perhaps on the battlefields of this coming war. But that is not all for you were also betrayed by one of your own. Someone you were close with. A friend, a mentor. You called him Latch. He shared information with the Mayor. Latch has taken on a different name, and moves quite far away from Thistleton. He now lives in Cape Lamar and goes by the name Mr. Grey. "

Teras pleads for more answers. In his head, "There is nothing adequate to this level of betrayal." Teras asks the voice who the fuck it is. No response.

The spirit returns. Teras refuses to leave the room, wanting more answers. 

The spirit serves the goddess of knowledge. Names are not so hard to know.

Eventually, Teras leaves the room so his friends can get answers.
