### Raw Notes
Genia throws her hood up and turns so her back is to the bar. She asks Viri to figure out why "that girl behind the bar is here."

Scarlet and Sky come in and tell us what happened to them, and we all get meatloaf. Viri heads up to the counter to gather intel on Cynthia. 

Viri poses as wanting to write a new song and asks Cynthia about herself, including asking if something bad that happened to her. Cynthia says she used to love to sail with her dad, but one day she asked and he said no so she went out by herself. There's a rocky area on the East side that her neighbors' boat she stole got crashed up on, but she's a quick thinker. She blamed it all on Gunner by planting one of his wrist bands on the broken boat. 

Then Viri says she doesn't look like she's from here, and she asks what should someone new to the area know about being here. Cynthia says she's very new, but people have told her not to hang around the Dock Ward at night, and not all of the lawmen around here are on the up and up so it's best to stay away from them too. 

Viri promises she'll play Cynthia her song in a few days.

Genia asks what Viri learned, and is disappointed with the results. She's also concerned about Teras getting recognized, so Sky druidcrafts him a flower crown. The tavern keeper tells us no magic inside, and in being yelled at Genia and Teras crash out of their chairs onto the floor, causing quite a ruckus. 

We decide to call it quits for the night, and all head up to bed. Viri tries to secure a room of her own, and is told there's no available tonight but tomorrow there will be an opening. Cynthia offers to let her sleep in the storeroom.

Genia and Teras get clocked on their way up the stairs, but Cynthia doesn't say anything. They barricade their room and Teras sleeps on the floor in front of the door. He also prays to the cigarette god to "make that girl forget she ever saw us." (Lots of mysterious typing noises and calls for odd rolls from Lockie.)

Everyone else goes to bed, Viri gets snuck into the back and tells Cynthia her song is done. Cynthia is moved by her performance and offers to sign her up as a performer at Muggsy Suds. 

In the morning, Genia asks Zephyr to check for the young barmaid to make sure she's gone. The opener is a dwarven man cooking breakfast. She returns to tell Genia.

Genia tells Teras she got information from her patron, but she'll probably need to act on it alone. Teras isn't very happy with that, and asks if she could take Zephyr along in disguise, or if they could meet up at noon to make sure she's safe. Genia says she'll ask Zephyr but if she has other plans she doesn't want to impose. 

Talbot drinks strong, gross coffee downstairs. A very well-dressed person walks in that Talbot recognizes as Jeeves. He's a bit red in the face, puts his hands behind his back and approaches Talbot. He asks if Talbot's acquaintances are also here, and Talbot says he is waiting for them to descend. He tells Talbot that there's been a mix up with our attendance at the Royal Ball, and only four additional tickets can be provided as the Herbone Visier has requested additional accommodations. He says if this has caused us any financial burden, he can compensate us for it. He also asks Talbot to deliver a package: "Jameson sends his condolences, he had a rough evening, but he was able to construct this and send it with me."

The rest of us come down and Talbot tells us the good and bad news. He also says it's unlikely we could just sneak in. We discuss strategy and decide that Teras will apply to be a bodyguard for Diana Jiovanovich, and Talbot will ask his employer if they have a spare ticket. If those plans fail, we will enter the spring games to win tickets. 

Sky, Teras, Viri, and Scarlet head to the Gleaming Shield, the logo is a circular shield with sun rays coming out from behind it. A plain sun in the symbol of Lumen, but worship of Lumen is forbidden here so they covered it with a shield.

Scarlet doesn't recognize anyone's face, but identifies who she thinks might be ex-Lightkeepers. She tells Teras to get a table. Teras and Viri sit, and Teras asks how she writes her lyrics then ignores her to listen to the Lightkeepers' table. Most of it is mundane, but they do talk about Wheaton briefly, as well as Seb's name. Not in a positive tone, and with some expletives thrown in. Teras tries to remember their faces as best he can, and Scarlet tries to flash her Lightkeeper symbol a little as she can see their symbols poorly hidden. They also mention Devic Sartosa got promoted to Eternal Flame in the Lightkeepers. 

Genia and Zephyr (in mouse form) approach the public entrance of the Law house and waits in line for the reception desk. She tells the goblin she's hoping to speak to Kendra, she's a witness to a crime. The goblin asks what crime she'd like to report and Genia says she only wants to talk to Kendra. The goblin says she's in a meeting but it will be done in 15 minutes, and she can ask if she'll speak to Genia then. 

When Genia gets to her office, she says "A friend told me vengeance is the best form of judgement." Kendra's demeanor changes, and she says she'll meet Genia in the alley behind Geronimo's Toys & Trinkets an hour after dusk this evening.  She asks Genia if she's sure she'd like to go down this path, and Genia tries to get more information but Kendra is very vague. Genia asks if there is power involved, and she says there is always power in justice. She also tells Genia to come alone next time.

Genia scouts out Geronimo's which is in the dock ward and goes in. She asks the attendant at the desk if they do toy repair. They say they do, it'll be one or two days and may cost a few gold pieces.

Talbot goes to see Yenna. On the way, he overhears someone discussing a recent execution a few days ago in the dock ward of a member of a religious cult called "Kai-teran." 

He arrives at the Haroun house, and Yenna asks how it's going. He says there have been some setbacks but overall things are progressing smoothly. And that Wheaton has been taken care of. "I've heard about your wonderful work there Marcion, we are currently working with the remainders of the company there." The Count has abdicated responsibility of management of the company, which Talbot says is unlike him. There's some bureacratic stuff going on that essentially forced his hand.

"As for my current assignment, I am accompanying the group I unexpectedly joined. Would you like me to remain with them?"

"As long as you think they are still useful in accomplishing your tasks."

Talbot agrees and says we are easily distracted, but we do help get results. They did manage to procure an artefact, after all. Yenna is interested in how we found the artefact, how it works, if there are more artefacts. He says he doesn't know much unfortunately, just how they were acquired. We haven't tested them at all, which attests to their lack of vision.

Yenna says she's like him to follow this thread, as it would be exceptionally detrimental to the safety of Cape Lamar if the artefacts fall into the wrong hands. He understands, and then asks her about the presence of this new cult. She is worried about it, particularly with the spring games approaching. There have been members of The Tempest that have been spreading dissent among the workers in the dock ward. The cult is an entirely new doomsday sort of thing also stirring up trouble, and both happening at the same time is dangerous. The execution was done as a preventative measure. She asks Talbot to look into it. 

The Tempest is a political revolutionary group.

Talbot asks if he can get a ticket to the ball, and Yenna says she can rearrange her entourage to give him one. She also says she remains suspicious of the Count given the recent activities in Wheaton, and the kind of political instability that may arise from it. She dismisses him and says she will put in a requisition request for him with the Royal Watch, and also give him his pay for Wheaton (100gp.)
