### Bulleted Notes

### Edited Long-Form Notes 

### Raw Notes
Talbot and Viri are in the office of Geronimo's. The police rule it's cardiac arrest, but the burnt-out eye sockets leave Talbot to think otherwise. Talbot finds a pouch with a clay figurine, which he knows is a component of [[tongues\|tongues]].

Talbot tells the commissioner he agrees that the death was natural, and asks if he can take the music box back to its owner. The commissioner asks him to fill out a form, but tells him he can take it.

Skye heads to a temple of Repara, though their search takes quite a while. They feel a stronger connection to Repara than they have felt in some time, and asks about the man they've seen in their dreams. Repara says she does not know him, and she has not sent him to them, although perhaps "one of my fellows is attempting to communicate with you." The oldest of us have the most primitive means of communication, one who lies on the other side of a closed door.

La Brillo Stado - Teras, Genia, and Zephyr head there together. We stop an employee on their smoke break, and they tell us to find the receptionist. She tells us to sit and wait until the chef can come out. The back room is fairly chaotic, and it takes about 30 minutes for the chef to come out. Tall, plump, human man just over 6ft with spectacles and the stereotypical chef uniform. We follow him into a wine cellar type thing. 

He introduces himself as Reginald, head chef and owner. We introduce ourselves, and then he asks what our qualifications are. Teras tells him he's handy with nature and they've guarded caravans before. The chef says this job requires being inconspicuous, and is worried about Teras' abilities to fit that description. 

Reginald says he'd like us to do a test run first, and asks them to leave something as collateral. Teras gives up his potion of adaptation. Regi takes it and returns with a vial of ruby dust. He wants it delivered to Vincent Hayes.

Skye asks Talbot about the commentator of the games, and confides that he's been showing up in their dreams. Talbot says he doesn't know much beyond what he's already told us. 

Teras recalls that ruby dust is used for continual flame. He and Genia head to Vincent's house. Genia knocks when we arrive. A voice call us in and we enter a small reception area. When Vincent exits, he is with a woman carrying crutches but walking perfectly fine. He's dressed like Socrates. 

We try to deliver directly to him but he insists he doesn't know Reginald and his wife can handle whatever our delivery is. His wife says they prefer to keep certain business relationships private.

We all meet up at Muggsy Suds. We discuss plans for events tomorrow, and then Talbot brings out the music box. Teras checks the box for strange languages but finds nothing. We discuss if the box killed him, if perhaps he cast tongues on himself so he could understand something, and whatever he heard killed him. Viri recalls a few spells that Kylian told her about that could have caused the burned-out eyeballs.

We decide to go talk to the guy who sold me the music box yesterday. Skye says they can talk to Geronimo, and Talbot tells us that he has a friend Alec who can get him and Skye into the morgue. Although interacting with the dead is typically frowned upon, Talbot thinks a sufficient bribe would convince Alec to look the other way.

A medium-height tabaxi woman (Dianna Yvanovich) finds us in Muggsy Suds. She chooses Scarlet to accompany her to the ball as her security. 

WE NEED ONE MORE TICKET (could be Talbot's lady or the games).

Talbot heads to the morgue with Skye, but Alec is not the one that answers the door. They make their way inside anyways, and learn that Geronimo was killed by magic by the box. He was trying to understand what the box was saying.

Talbot knows of the shop I got the box from, run by Brandon Fellgrass, trinkets/magic items store in the market ward. Has no sort of reputation. 

Brandon tells us that the box was bought in a bulk order from salvagers that search shipwrecks in the area. It registered as faintly magical, and he thinks the ballerina figurine resembles Nerys, a mythological figure related to the Prime Tetrad, who Mordys (the god of death) fell in love with and attempted to make her his Princess and reside on the throne in the afterlife. Many versions of the story, in some the other gods intervene, in some other creatures (dragons, demons, etc.) intervened, in others the hubris of Mordys is his downfall, he kills her by taking her into the afterlife. 

I check the music box with Brandon's detect magic box: necromancy, evocation, enchantment. Evocation seems the strongest, necromancy the weakest, but they all seem very faint.

We head to the Academy to see if someone can identify this box, and Talbot tells us he has a connection who can keep the work discrete. On the way, Genia asks what he knows about Vincent. Talbot knows what most of the public knows, as well as that he charges rich people for healing services.

Diana and Scarlet meet at the bathhouse. She tells her she would like to move to the other side of the wall (into the High Ward), and as such needs to act like she already has the wealth of someone who lives there. She also tells her that she is applying for a waiver so Scarlet can bring in her weapons. Scarlet is mostly a status symbol, and Diana is not expecting any threats on her life.
