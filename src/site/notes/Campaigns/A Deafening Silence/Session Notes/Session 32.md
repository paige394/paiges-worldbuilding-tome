The guards try to bust into Skye's room without telling them what they're arresting them for, and Teras goes into the hall to try and diffuse/distract. Genia minor illusions the sound of Skye running away and saying "Can't catch me!"

Viri tells the guards Skye is someone they don't want to mess with and successfully scares them off, meanwhile Teras runs to get Talbot. Talbot says Skye should have just gone with them, but the second best option is going down to the station now.

A mysterious hooded gnome gets Teras, Skye, and Zephyr, and tells them the tavern we are staying at for the ingredient retrieval is The Eagles' Nest - three for Reggie.

We decide to take all of us, and stop at a Royal Watch Post on the way out to clear Skye's name.

Town crier - Vincent Hayes killed in his home last night. Lots of public mourning going on in the dock ward. There is a large crowd gathered outside of the Dock Ward outpost of the Royal Watch. 

Talbot makes his way inside to get Skye in, but finds out that Officer Jones (the one who interviewed him) has waived the charges. We all head out of the city together. 

Talbot receives a message from Yenna when we are settled at the Eagles' Nest, apparently the Count waived Skye's charges and Yenna would like to speak with Talbot. 

Directions to the cabin - "We're making a delivery for Reggie." They can be peculiar so follow their instructions. We can verify we've received the right package if it makes a slight buzzing sound. 

Viri gets a message from Jeeves - "Your presence is requested for a rehearsal tomorrow before the ball."

Teras messages Ofeus - he is still researching, but may know more tomorrow. 

Teras, Genia, and Zephyr head out to their dropoff.
