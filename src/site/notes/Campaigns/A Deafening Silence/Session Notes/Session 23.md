The Staff of Marzul is reportedly located in the Lost Mines.

Talbot knows: The Lost Mines of Chdeken. They mined too deep and awoke some great evil. Largely dwarven mine/city, roughly 100mi SW from Cape Lamar. Lots of speculation as to specifics, but the mines were abandoned and the surrounding towns were mysteriously massacred or vanished. The Barren Hold is a town 10-15mi from the edge of the mine entrance. Turned into a military outpost (the last remaining bastion near the mine) to keep watch on its activity. They try to send an expedition every few years to find more information. Most don't learn anything, some disappear. Those that do return report lots of spooky noises and beasties.

As we head to the Muggsy Suds (Inn & Tavern), Talbot spots a cordoned-off police-taped area as well as a few royal watchmen, and picks up a sewer-like smell, which is unusual for the ward. Sky spots a woman standing (curly hair, shoulder length, blue cloak with symbols woven into it) looking up a the back of a building that appears to have some holes in the back wall. The woman casts a spell, and the wall is fixed. This is seen down an alleyway.

Talbot heads towards the crime scene and notices that the sewer(?) is tightly sealed, but still stinks. The guards complain everything is safe, just stinky. They are waiting on the Royal Plumber to return from under the sewers.

Sky and Neviri startle the spellcaster. They burst into tears. Neviri suspects they were expecting the authorities. When Sky asks what's wrong, the woman says she lost her...frogs? She was testing some potions that would make frogs smaller, Jane's friends spilled some of it, during the cleanup the frogs became big again....I think???

Scarlet peels open a sewer grate as the lady thinks that's where the frogs may have gone. She says the frogs and the sewers aren't dangerous. They are only ~3ft wide. She retreats to go get some more shrinking potion.

Talbot wanders over and says he can help them with their problem, but he doesn't seem particularly happy about it.

The woman returns with some potions -> light blue reduces, should last indefinitely on frogs. 

Talbot leads them to a more secluded sewer hatch, and they head in.

Cut to the rest of us - exiting the high ward. You have to go through the casino in order to do so. None of us are interested in gambling at the moment. 

Market ward is noticeably grimier, lots of litter and also flyers everywhere.

Flyers: Diana Jiovanovich, proprieter of Squeaky Clean Baths seeks an escort/guard for the Royal Ball. Tavern Keeper's Guild, Gleaming Shield, Muggy Suds, The Laughing Monkey, hiring cooks and barkeeps. Reginald VonHoff (La Brillo Stado), famous chef, needs help accumulating exotic ingredients. The Seaman's Swell seeks deckhands and assistant chef for training voyage to Falante Island and Urbo City leaving May 7th, contact Dock Warden for more information. Private Security for the Southern Quarry wanted, apply at offices. Federicci and Simmons in The Exchange. Magus Rhobin Argyle of the Xhardosian Academy of the cape seeks a new apprentice, high level mages invited to apply. 

Viri buys a chain shirt. Teras buys a magical music box that doesn't play music, and two four-person tents.

The sewer gang - it's stanky down there. It starts to smell like gasoline as they move. Talbot can hear a distinct hissing noise (snake-like) up ahead. He also sees a very large, dead-looking frog.  Sky casts light on a stone and tosses it down the hallway, and the group sees loads of snake corpses. The rock plunges into the water ahead and the hissing stops for a few seconds. A huge monster bursts out of the water and through the wooden barricade.
