### Raw Notes
We head across the tree bridge, Talbot slips and falls on his ass in the mud. Teras apologizes to the Urmother, as he thinks the forest may be sentient. Talbot thinks the whole forest is interconnected. Sky realizes that the plants that attacked us have signs of decay and corruption in them, which is perhaps why we were attacked unprovoked.

We see large tracks continuing North along the riverbank, but our compass points us to Odron, in the East. The prints were made within the last few days. We continue following the compass, avoiding altercations for the most part. The forest is perpetually dusky, but we can guess we are approaching dinner time when Talbot finds some bloodroot, which can be harvested and used to make a convincing fake blood. 

Teras finds a dark greenish-black vine with white dots called starbloom, which can be used to recreate the effects of faerie fire. He also sees a vine with light pinkish leaves, siren's call which can create a philter of love. He asks the Urmother's blessing before harvesting one helping of starbloom.

We come upon a small cabin with a tidy garden, and noises of banging and clanging and alchemy. Genia knocks and a voice asks who we are, when she replies 'Friends of Marge' he says he is very busy and we should go away. She opens the door anyways, and we see a tree-man-deer creature doing some sort of alchemy.

He enlists Genia and I to stir and flip shit while we try and convince him we need help. The drow have captured the Urmother and are going to replace her as the matron of the forest. Odron is making a potion to release the drow's influence on her, but he's missing two ingredients. The head of three quantum pixies (three live pixies), and two of Avalech's Tears (big old pinecones that grow at the top of certain magical willow trees). There's a grove of pixies nearby, and a willow tree about three miles Northwest. The tree will try to shake you off, and are guarded by soldiers of the wood. If you get in and out in a minute, the soldiers won't arrive. The pixies disappear if you look right at them. 

Viri, Genia, and Teras are going to get the sprites. Sky, Talbot, and Kylian are going to get the pinecones. 

Viri, Genia, and Teras make it to the sprite clearing as it begins to rain. Teras and Genia try to look in a large area and corral the sprites, while Viri casts hypnotic pattern with the mirror to try and stun them. She gets two of them, but we need a third. Viri casts hypnotic pattern again, and nabs a third. We head back to Odron's.

Kylian, Sky, and Talbot head to the willow tree. They smell the acrid tang of smoke somewhere South of them, as well as the smells of something cooking. They see a small fire, with a pot of soup, attended by a rabbit. They ask if he can help them find a willow tree nearby, and he offers them some soup. Talbot notices some zapthistle in the broth, which is commonly eaten by rabbits but may be slightly toxic to other species. Talbot once again asks after the tree, but the rabbit shakes its head. 

They make it to the tree, and Talbot tries his best to scamper up. Sky gives him guidance, and the tree begins to shake violently. He gets the first one successfully, but Sky and Kylian can see the guardians starting to form. He gets the second one, and the gang starts their escape. As they walk away, the tree calms. 

Sprite crew returns to Odron with the jar. He chops the pixies up and melts them down. Pinecone gang returns shortly after. After a short rest, he pours up a large jar of shiny purple liquid and tells us it's done. 

As we head out, Odron explains that there's round the clock watches on the Urmother. We'll start by taking out the guards and getting Odron into the tomb. He's gotta grind up Avalech's skull and put it into the potion while we keep the drow and their minions away from the Urmother.
