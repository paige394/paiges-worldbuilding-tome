### Bulleted Notes

### Edited Long-Form Notes 

### Raw Notes
Talbot, Teras, Zephyr, Genia head to the academy to meet Gregor. He has been a security guard at the academy for over ~30 years. Talbot is able to get us to him., but Gregor calls him Marchion. We can tell Talbot genuinely likes him.

We tell Gregor about the music box and he directs us to Ofeus, the curator of the museum and the first stop for anyone with a strange magical item. Talbot also says we need to consult someone on the uses of ruby dust, and Gregor directs us to Igor, one of the professors on the teaching side. The third thing Talbot asks is about his family. Gregor says he and his wife are getting close to retiring, and Evie is headed out to Wheaton and then maybe Thistleton. 

Viri heads back to the Muggsy suds after looking around for Kylian. Anyone she asks has directed her to the High Ward, but she doesn't have time to follow up before the games. Scarlet and Skye join her at the tavern.

We go to Ofeus' office and Talbot knocks. A tall, skinny, elvish man wearing academic robes. When Talbot mentions that Gregor sent us, he brightens considerably. He asks us to show him the box, and we give him a brief background. Ofeus is quite puzzled by the item, but says he can investigate it. He notes the figure's similarity to Nerys as well, and recounts a myth where she would dance in the ballrooms of the afterlife which brought joy to both Nerys and the god of death. 

Count Henn von Himm announces the start of the caber toss. There are significantly less than for the pie eating contest. We each get three tries to throw the log as far as we can. Skye has a series of bad rolls and doesn't place, but Teras gets second. Might be good to invest in some strength potions.

Teras, Genia, Sky, Talbot, and Zephyr enter the steeplechase. Talbot and Zephyr get cat's grace from Skye. Talbot and Teras get bardic inspirations from Viri. There are 200+ contestants in this race. Teras and Zephyr are disqualified in horrifying fashion (tripping and taking a bunch of people out, shittin' on da track.) Talbot (as Lino) qualifies for the games.

After the qualifiers, Viri, Scarlet, and Skye go to the High Ward to look for more information on Kylian. Teras, Genia, Talbot, and Zephyr go see Igor. 

Viri does not glean much information. If anyone did see Kylian, they don't remember him. 

We have to wait for Igor to finish a class and learn some fascinating things about Talbot, including that he considers himself to be "more open than us with most" and that he's killed at least 25 people in his line of work. He says that he trusts his order to be in the best interest of the city. Igor finally arrives, dressed similarly to Ofeus. A tall human woman, Igor Savinsky, senior professor of spellcasting. We ask about the ruby dust, and she tells us that [[continual-flame\|continual-flame]], or with more ruby dust than we delivered, "a spell that wards a large space against transportation magics and damages certain creatures," "one that can create a magical prison and entrap even extremely powerful beings," or she tells us about [[simulacrum\|simulacrum]]. With whole rubies, you can summon fiends, demons, or devils. If you had enough ruby dust, you could potentially fuse it into a ruby. 

We thank her, but before we leave she tells us Gregor wanted to see Marchion again to show him something. She also asks us to deliver a 6-inch glass sphere to him as a gift for his 30th anniversary. Talbot and splits off to do that while Teras, Zephyr, and Genia head to La Brillo Stado. 

The chef seems agitated today, but takes us down into the wine cellar. He tells us he was disappointed in our performance, but that we did good enough to get the real job. He asks us to meet him at The Laughing Monkey in the Market Ward. The innkeeper's name is Beth. Tomorrow morning, say we have an appointment with Richard. The assignment will likely require being out of time for a night.

A docent(?) tells Marchion he is wanted in the High Ward at the royal watch headquarters for results on an ink analysis and also a discussion of "inappropriate actions with corpses."

Tonight is when Luck asked us to assist in giving a shakedown to some thugs, and tomorrow we were expecting our clothes to be ready.
