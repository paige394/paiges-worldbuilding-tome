- she sneaks down the alley alone

Viri asks if the person is ok, they say they're fine just go away. The figure doesn't want to divulge any more information when Viri asks. Viri calls for Genia and Teras and explains the situation. Viri asks if they live near here, and if they want us to walk them home. They affirm, but point to a building across the street. 

Viri says she'll be staying at the inn here if the person needs any help. Genia asks what the guys wanted, and the person reveals they owe a few hundred gold. It seems like a young gnomish boy (or maybe man)?

Scarlet moves to shrink the frogs - at least one is alive but unconscious. Talbot is able to revive Sky to 1hp, with 1 level of exhaustion. Scarlet lassos the other frog in, it is also alive but unconscious. 

Talbot discerns that the snakes are a poisonous variety that prefer to knock their prey unconscious first - likely what knocked the frogs out. He tries to figure out what killed the snakes, but there are no visible wounds. When he tries to harvest the venom, it seems they're dried out.

The sewer gang heads out, but Talbot hears muffled noises through the manhole cover above them. They sound like the guards he spoke to earlier. Talbot is unable to life the grate, and asks Sky but they refuse. Seems they are a little salty about being downed by Talbot. Scarlet moves to push the grate open, but it feels stuck.

Scarlet starts banging on the grate to get help. The guards ask who the fuck is down there, and Scarlet explains that she was helping a lady find her frogs. 

Sky gets confrontational while the guards work to remove the caulk on the sewer grate. Talbot seems unphased, "It all worked out in the end. knowing the terrain in which we were fighting seemed to be a worthy goal."

The guards finally remove the grate and the sewer crew is able to leave. Scarlet and Sky start to leave, but Talbot shows them the snake carcass he dragged up. Almar Greystroke is the name Talbot gives the guards. 

Talbot departs for his apartment while Sky and Scarlet go to the witch's apartment building. She is overjoyed that the frogs lived, although complains about Sky and Scarlet's stinkiness. She gives them 20gp and two vials - a blue and red, a reducing and enlarging potion that works indefinitely on creatures small or tiny, or for an hour on larger creatures. Ikron is the lady's name.

Sky and Scarlet split the money 50/50. They both go to the ocean to swim.

Muggsy Suds crew secures rooms and asks about a hot springs - the barkeep says there's only an ocean. Genia and Teras are astounded by the ocean. 5sp/night/room includes two meals per person per day. Viri tells the barkeep people are being jumped in the alley outside her establishment, and she says "Understood."

Genia tries to convince Teras to sleep in a bed that night. Meatloaf shenanigans ensue. Teras gifts Genia the music box. She tries to fix it but doesn't know enough about it. Teras asks Viri to fix it, and she opens it up to see that there is nothing physically wrong with it. 

Scarlet and Sky head straight to the beach, getting a lot of odd looks as they do so. It takes them a bit of time, but they manage it. The ocean is not super calm, but not necessarily dangerous. Scarlet dumps her pack and shoes and wades into the water. Sky takes everything off and cleans their armor. 

Scarlet asks why Sky wanted to come to the beach, and they said because it's free and they wanted to see the ocean for the first time. Their clergy work didn't take them very far around the country. Sky also rants about Talbot not helping them with the chull. Scarlet talks about wanting to replace their armor since it feels dirty to walk around with Lightkeeper armor.

Sky and Scarlet make it to Muggsy Suds, and at the same Genia hears the barmaid say "Ah thank god, Cynthia you're finally here! Take over, I've gotta clean up."
