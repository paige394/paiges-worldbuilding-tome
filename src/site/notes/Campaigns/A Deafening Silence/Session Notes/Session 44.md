### Bulleted Notes

### Edited Long-Form Notes 

### Raw Notes
Teras walks up out of the well, almost in a trance. Skye tries to follow, asking if he's okay and offering Teras their mace. Teras ignores them and makes his way outside. Once there, he screams and charges a tree before punching it down. He watches it fall, then cries. Skye awkwardly comforts him, and Teras awkwardly ignores it.

Viri says that she knows where Kylian is - in the mines of Chedecken, but she has to bring him back here so the goddess can cleanse him. Scarlet asks what she had to pay, and Viri says she has the feeling the goddess will have a few more tasks for her after Kylian's rescue.

Genia returns looking very chipper, much more so than Viri or Teras. She lets us know that she learned the Cloak of Kaisen is located on a different plan of existence, which can be accessed via the Isle of Xernia. She does not disclose what she had to give up.

Scarlet is wary after Teras' reaction, but is willing to go in to ask about one of the seven items. She returns not too long after, looking a little dejected but not overly upset. It told her the Shield of Eylucia is in the possession of the leader of the Lightkeepers. Scarlet recalls that there is a whole set of ceremonial armor given to the head of the Lightkeepers, including the shield. She is noticeably missing her magical rapier.

Talbot volunteers to go in for the last item. He exits looking slightly more disheveled than when he entered. His conversation is slightly longer than we would expect. The Staff Marzul is in the mines. Talbot had to give up one of his identities for it. Viri asks how many identities he had, and he says six. 

Zephyr enters. She leaves looking slightly more disheveled, and reveals that she traded knowledge of one of her languages for her sister's backstory. Some evil guy stole her from the village along with most of the memories of her and made her an apprentice and an assassin. She left him, and was a free agent for a bit before being captured by the Mayor of Thistleton. He eventually tried to kill her when he realized he no longer needed her, but she escaped and has begun her quest for revenge.

Skye makes their way back in as everyone else leaves, presumably to ask their question.

We think we've been in the Well for a little over an hour. The sun has begin to set.

Skye returns, looking slightly worse for wear. They go speak to Genia (which will be moved to next week) to decipher the cryptic message they received. They tell the rest of us they asked about the Count and Mordresh. It's unclear what any of the connections are. 

Viri asks if they know why they are specifically being targeted, but they say they aren't sure. 

We all return to the caravan and continue on our journey to the mines. Skye sees a large column of smoke up ahead, and can also see an encampment with walls and a watchtower about a mile away. Twyla pulls out a map and says it might be the expedition party's basecamp. It's about a mile or so from the mines themselves, so we made good time.

A person in the watchtower calls out 'Who goes there?' Twyla tells Viri to take it away. 

Viri says we're here to help out the mining effort, and that no one in particular sent us, we just wanted to help out. The guard asks if we have a healer, and when Viri says we do they let us in.

The encampment has one tower, a big fire, a large wagon, and a few small tents. The guard greets us as Sargent Jones, and says it's good to see some friendly faces. He then asks Skye to take a look at the two soldiers by the fire.

The soldiers are unresponsive. A lieutenant attending them explains the expedition got here a week ago, entered the mines a few days ago, and in the administrative offices were attacked by some large slimey insects. These two were poisoned by the insects' bite. About ten others from the expedition left a few days ago to continue their expedition.

Skye can tell they are indeed suffering a poison, requiring a lot of time or the [[lesser-restoration\|lesser-restoration]] spell. They ask how long they've been unconscious, and the sergeant says the screaming stopped a few days ago and they've been like this since. Skye tries some goodberries first, to no effect. They step aside to consider their repertoire for a moment.

Viri asks the Sergeant if anyone matching Kylian's description was with the party, but they say no. Jones' asks us why we came out here, and Viri says we always need more work but she's also trying to find the man she's looking for. The sergeant tells us the expedition will be back tomorrow, and we can head out with them once they've returned.

Skye returns having prepared [[lesser-restoration\|lesser-restoration]], and fixes up the two soldiers. Twyla dishes out some mead and we have a nice meal before heading to bed.

Sergeant and lieutenant take the first watch. Talbot and Teras take second watch. 

Talbot asks Teras how he is doing. Teras says he is doing bad, and asks Talbot how he keeps his identities real. Talbot had a procedure done to erase all emotional attachment to his real identity. They keep having a philosophical conversation. Teras tells the story of a young boy who cheered for him in the crowds and then feared him after he killed a beast. Talbot tells him he can either be feared or loved to gain respect, and Teras tells him he's not sure what he wants any more. Talbot confesses to him that the name he was born under was Marchian.

In the morning the lieutenant thanks Skye again, and then asks if we hear something. We hear a faint "help!" and a column of smoke to the West. We all gear up and hop onto our horses, heading towards the mines. We arrive to a fight!
