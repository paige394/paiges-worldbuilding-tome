Teras calls everyone over and uses the Box of Rejuvenation to give everyone a short rest.

We cannot hear any more approaching drow. Teras notices that Odron's body is decaying rapidly and actively, and he finds a notebook falling out of his robes.

Reading the notebook, Teras discerns that after the solution has been administered, we need to do some sort of ritual to active the elixir. I probably couldn't perform it, but a magic user could.

Genia approaches Viri and asks what happened to Odron. She says an old lady showed up and killed him in a pretty gruesome way. Genia seems surprised and a little befuddled. She quietly responds, "I think it's a good thing she came and did what she needed to do, cause I don't think I could have done it."

Viri says it all worked out, but Genia says she's not sure and that it feels different now.

Teras asks Talbot if he's ever seen anything like "that" before, meaning the way Odron is decaying. Talbot says no and he hopes he never does, talking about Genia's patron's appearance and killing of Odron. Teras clarifies, and Talbot says no.

Teras approaches Viri and asks if she can make any sense of the ritual in the back of Odron's book. She looks it over and thinks she can.

Talbot asks if he's okay, and Teras says no but he doesn't think Talbot can fix it. Talbot reassures him that he is here to listen, and keeps him company as they sit in silence. Teras says not right now.

We begin to hear drow approach as Viri finishes the ritual. With her last words, we hear a sudden crack and then Odron's head snaps up and he speaks one word: "Kaisen."

The Urmother awakens with a terrible rustling and cracking of bones before snapping her jaws towards us. She crunches down onto a Drider behind us, and spits it out in disgust. As she comes down, her thunderous paws hit the ground and flings us up into the canopy. We come crashing down in front of Odron's house.

WE LEVEL UP!
