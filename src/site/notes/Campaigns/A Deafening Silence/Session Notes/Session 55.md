Odron and Genia are in a standoff. We have a big, long, confusing standoff. Genia tries to pull out her tome but cannot physically open it.

Genia claims the following. Her patron says we may have history with Odron, after Bartholomew he may have reason to wish us harm. And while the drow are attempting to control the Urmother, so is Odron. 

We ask Odron if he knows Cornelius Bloom, the druid we had to kill in Bartholomew. He says he was a friend. 

The group consensus is that if Odron is trying to kill us, this is an incredibly elaborate plot to do so and we can handle ourselves if he does. Teras says he doesn't completely trust him, but he doesn't trust Genia's patron either.

Odron moves to resume his work. Genia swings. Teras moves to shove her out of the way. 

Rd 1.
- Genia hits the vial, it cracks even more but it does not shatter 
- Teras attempts to shove Genia back
- Talbot asks Genia why she trusts a nameless patron over her companions who have shed blood for her, and Genia asks doesn't he trust his patron? To which he replies no
- Sky banishes Genia
- Scarlet claps in front of Odron and asks what the hell he's doing, he says he will proceed

Teras prays to cigarette man. We feel a burst of air.

We rush over and see an elderly woman in a black cloak with grey hair and a cane. Her left hand lifts a paralyzed Odron into the sky, and she says "Odron, of Rentlam forest! You have wronged me once, you will not wrong me again."

We hear a loud snapping sound as she breaks his neck. She turns to us and says, "Toodleoo friends. You best be preparing. There's more drow coming."

Sky asks Genia if she'll kill her if they heal the Urmother. She says no. Everyone else prepares for battle.

Teras tears down a tree in anger and frustration before breaking down into tears.

The drow come.
