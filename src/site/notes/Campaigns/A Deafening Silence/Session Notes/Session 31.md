### Bulleted Notes

### Edited Long-Form Notes 

### Raw Notes
Tonight is when Luck asked us to assist in giving a shakedown to some thugs, and tomorrow we were expecting our clothes to be ready.

We head to Lucky's Charms and he sets us up in the storeroom for an ambush.

Talbot heads to to pick up his ink analysis results and answer questions about his activities in the morgue. Ink is from Traxeldorf - Talbot knows it's a fairly insular nation, lots of mining, most people that go there go for work. The type of snake carcass that he saw in the sewers is from Traxeldorf, and the executed cultist's apartment had an aquarium with the Western Red Snow Viper. 

Back to the storeroom - roll for initiative!

Genia goes up to the dead guy in the alley and covers herself in his blood. We rifle through the leader's bag, including lots of normal survival and adventuring gear, the sending stone, 4gp; and other thugs' stuff: 4 shortswords, 2 longswords, a dagger, a milky white vial.

Luck gives us our payment and informs us he will be leaving town. Viri asks who these guys were again, and Luck says they were hired by Mr. Grey. 

Talbot warns Skye that the Royal Watch may come to question them, and advises them on phrasing to keep their stories aligned.

Genia heads to Vincent Hayes' and knocks on the door. Vincent opens the door and Genia pretends she was attacked by men in the street and asks to come in. He falls for it totally and ushers her into his office (similar to a doctor's office). Genia stumbles and falls onto the ground, and as he bends down to assist her she tries to stab him with the syringe. 

Vincent is clearly shocked, and he falls over and begins writhing on the ground. Genia flees and heads back to Muggsy Suds.

We awake to the sounds of boots in the hallway, and knocking on Skye's door.
