Viri heads to rehearsal at the Count's. Jam session goes okay, but Viri tries to ask The Earl about Kylian. He looks afraid/the color drains from his face. He tells her this is not the place to discuss it.

When we wake in the morning, there is a wooden crate in front of Genia and Teras' room door. It says 'To Genia'. Inside is a closed burlap sack, a vial, and an envelope. The vial appears to have a few strands of light blonde hair in it. The envelope contains a card that reads - "Dearest Genia, I do not appreciate your recent decision to meddle in a contract dispute. I hope you will understand that we have had to take certain measures to ensure that this contract is upheld. Please deliver the requisite goods or 1000gp to the Tinkle by dusk tomorrow. Otherwise, your friendly neighborhood barkeep will suffer. Better luck next time. Mr. Grey."

Inside the bag is the severed head of a gnome - the Jewelry store owner from next door, Luck Pinkle.

Viri and Teras go talk to the bartender while everyone else makes their way to Luck's jewelry shoppe. Luck was delivering lots of jewels (rubies) and gold to Mr. Gray. There is an unchecked delivery of diamonds that we think must be the 'requisite goods.' They don't find them anywhere in the jewelry. We need to head to 'Mortuary's Mines' HQ  to speak to Gideon, Luck's contact for illicit goods.

They gather Viri and I and we all head to Mortuary Mines HQ. Talbot's attempts at playing it cool start out unsuccessful, but then the receptionist tells us that Gideon is a foreman of one of the mines. He is out at the mines for the next week, but we can communicate with him via parchment. We decide to tell him we are friends of Mr. Luck and that he is in a tight spot and needs his delivery rushed to the next day.

Gideon tells us to meet his associate at the Wandering Giant tomorrow (an inn and tavern in the dock ward).

Scarlet makes her way to Squeaky Clean Baths to speak to Dianna. She said she had a very interesting conversation with a member of the Count's staff when she went to register Scarlet as her security. She will be allowed a small weapon for protection. Dianna also says she found out that Scarlet was a registered agent of the Count, and wonders why she's not attending the ball as a relation of the Count.
