### Bulleted Notes
- Lots of combat!
- We all start off running to get to where Zephyr is. She turns into a bear to defend herself.
- By the time we arrive, more workers and some direwolves have emerged. Zephyr is pretty down bad.
- We hear rumbling and shaking from the East, with the noise approaching the lumber mill.
- Teras gets surrounded, everyone else continues to rain down ranged attacks.
- Viri meets the assassin, and convinces her she means no harm.
- By the grace of the gods (aka Sky's healing) we manage to not die for a while.
- A giant stone golem with a corrupted ruby heart appears from the forest.
- The assassin [[dimension-door\|dimension-door]]s herself and Viri to within range of the battle.
- Mr. Lena joins our side.
- Scarlet recognizes the golem to be possessed by Janeus.
- Genia lands the final blow on Mr. Berr. We've won that battle, but not the war yet.
