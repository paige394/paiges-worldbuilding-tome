### Bulleted Notes
- The combat continues!
- We clean up the last few Berr minions and Mr. Lena flees inside.
- The golem hits Sky and Teras with a black goo that robs Teras of his BA and RAs.
- Teras clambers up onto the golem and attacks the heart. Everyone else unleashes hell from afar.
- Talbot attempts to AT-AT cable trip the golem, unfortunately unsuccessfully.
- We kill the golem. Scarlet does some math - it has been five days since we last saw Janeus.
- We speak to Mr. Lena, who says he'll work with the remaining Lawkeepers to clean up the mess and get the lumber mill back to it's usual capacity. He will honor the original agreement with the druids.
- Mr. Lena doesn't know about the Wood's Widow, but a lower rank worker named Frankie does. He tells us he overheard Mr. Berr speaking of a valuable shipment.
- Viri tips him a coin, and when he says a few more would reveal more information she threatens him instead. He reveals there is an entrance to the tunnels in the officers' meeting room.
- We search Mr. Berr's office and find a business letter from "Count Henn von Himm" of Cape Lamar, and a pleasure letter from "Miss B," a worker at Don DeMarco's.
- A hidden compartment in his desk has the vial of Wood's Widow.
- We head to the druids and tell them their problem has been taken care of. When we ask how to dispose of the Wood's Widow, Marge suggests extreme hot or cold.
- Marge asks about the assassin, and reveals that she was a former member of the circle, taken from them by the evil thing that resided in the abandoned cottage.
- She was not Zephyr's twin, but an older sibling. Whatever took her also robbed the druids (except for Marge) of any memories of her.
- We spend the night at the druid's camp.

The ruby heart shatters, Sky and Teras are hit by a few shards.

Talbot asks where the golem came from, Scarlet provides that she is being pursued by a revenant. It has been five days since we last saw the revenant. 

We discuss what to do about the Wood's Widow. We decide to speak to Mr. Lena first, then stay with the druids an extra day to make sure they aren't attacked.

We walk inside.

Mr. Lena asks if the golem is taken care of, and syas he wasn't expecting that. Viri asks what's next, Mr. Lena says they'll work with what's left of the Lawkeepers to clean up the mess and send a message to the Cape asking for more labor to continue operations as they once were. 

Talbot says they will get whatever lmaterials they need to keep production ongoing.

Teras asks if Mr. Lena is aware of what Mr. Berr's been up to, and he says he knew negotiations were tense but he doesn't know anything specific. He asks if Mr. Lena knew about Wood's Widow, who denies it. Teras (NAT 20) can tell Frankie looks nervous at the question. He asks Talbot if someone were to come forward, would they be granted a pardon from their prior misgivings. 

Frankie say's he's heard of it, overheard a conversation Mr. Berr and Gur that they were receiving a shipment from Mr. DeMarco that would turn the tides in their favor. 

Genia and Teras go outside to search the bodies.

Viri flips him a copper and thanks him for his work. Frankie says he could volunteer more information for a few more of those, and Viri pulls a dagger. He is sufficiently intimidated. The entrance to the tunnel system is in the meeting room for the officers in the back. Viri asks for her copper back, and he complies. 

Teras and Genia find 13gp, beaten up weapons and armor, and a set of keys on Mr. Berr. We ransack his office while Talbot and Mr. Lena discuss business.

Genia rifles through correspondence on his desk - received letter from "Count Henn von Himm", address in Cape Lamar, update on the state of business and wood production numbers. Letter from "Miss B", the prostitute in Don DeMarco's that Teras tried to woo. 

Teras finds a hidden compartment on the side of the desk, which is locked, but he unlocks it with the keyring. Inside is a small glass jar filled with white whispy spore like things. Included is a document on how it's spread and what it does (a copy of the one Viri found).

When Talbot rejoins us, Genia asks if he knows von Himm. He does, he is one of the ruling members of the Noble Pantheon - the wealthiest merchant appointee to the court. It would make total sense for him and Mr. Berr to be in correspondence.

We give the meeting room a cursory tousle through. There's not much of interest, but we do find a wooden block hiding the entrance to the tunnel system. It looks caved in here as well. 

We all head to the druids. First, Sky recovers some broken splint armor from Paul. At the meeting spot, Marge and Seb are waiting for us. Scarlet tells Seb about the golem/Janeus, and Talbot says that business has been taken care of.

Teras asks if they know how to dispose of the Wood's Widow, and Marge says getting it very hot or very cold would probably work. She asks if we met the person committing the atrocities Mr. Berr was blaming the druids for (the assassin). Viri says she was a real piece or work, and Marge says "She? It is as I feared."

We asks her what it is she feared. Marge says she was a former member of the circle, who was taken from them by the evil thing or whatever evil resided in the abandoned cottage.

Viri asks how long ago she was taken, Marge says many years - over a decade. Not Zephyr's twin, but an older sibling. Marge says their parents are still alive, but whatever evil took the child was powerful, and also took the Circle's memories of her. Marge says she is too powerful for the magic to have worked.

Marge invites us to spend the night at the druid encampment. On the walk, she pulls Genia aside.

She tells Genia she was informed of the incident with Pascal, and asks if it has ever happened before. Genia asks if it's important, and Marge gives a vague and ominous warning that it could be.

We all do various character-based tasks before bed. Nothing much of note.
