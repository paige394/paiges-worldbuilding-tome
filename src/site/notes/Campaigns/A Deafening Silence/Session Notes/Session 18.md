### Bulleted Notes
- We discuss how we will find the Wood's Widow and deal with Mr. Berr before negotiations with the druids tonight.
- Viri, Zephyr, Sky, and Scarlet take a short rest. Genia, Teras, and Talbot go back to search Zansy's house again.
- The searchers find a stolen letter on one of the dead guards: written in common , in a cipher like in Moresec's letters. Signed "S." A sticky note attached to the letter in common says, "Your reward can be located at the usual spot. - Don."
- We drop the letter off with the resters to let them decipher it, then head to the stash box in the tunnels near Don DeMarco's. There is a guard there who says he hasn't seen anyone come down here other than Don and his men, who were just in the storage room side.
- We attempt to follow Zansy's trail out of town, but it is clear that he is a long way ahead of us on the road. 
- Zephyr breaks enough of the cipher to learn that the new letter is S giving instructions to Zansy on the location where his caravan will be "raided" along the route to Thistleton. Talbot recognizes the landmark as Owlbear Rock, a 6-8 hour journey from here.
- We rejoin the resters and head to the forest near the lumber mill. Talbot and Zephyr wait near the lumberyard to signal us when Mr. Berr leaves. They see a group of employees apparently preparing for a fight.
- In the forest, we see some small footprints that Viri tracks along the river for 10 minutes or so. She sees the meetup spot, and the footprints disappear at the base of a tall oak tree. She can tell that some bits of bark have been knocked off recently.
- Zephyr tries to sneak into the lumberyard as a cat. An employee sees her and thinks she's "too sick to be saved" when she tries to fake a hurt paw. He snaps the cat's neck, turning it back into Zephyr. We all roll initiative.

### Edited Long-Form Notes 
Absent: Haley|Scarlet

### Raw Notes
We are in the basement of the lawkeeper building.

Two items: find Zansy and the Wood's Widow; kill Mr. Berr.

About 3 hours left to dusk - and a few people need short rests. The messenger boy escaped the fight with the town guard, and Paul knew Viri and Talbot were going to chase down the messenger. it is likely Mr. Berr will be on high alert no matter what time we encounter him.

Viri, Zephyr, Sky, and Scarlet take a short rest. Genia, Teras, and Talbot go back to search Zansy's house. Folded up on a guard's dead body (they found and stole it) is a letter: written in common , in a cipher like in Moresec's letters. Signed "S." A sticky note attached to the letter in common that says, "Your reward can be located at the usual spot. - Don."

Teras makes a little more progress breaking the cipher.

We decide to drop the letter off with the resters, and then head to the stash box near DeMarcos. Zephyr gets the gist of the new message - S is giving instructions to Zansy on the location where his caravan will be "raided" along the route to Thistleton.

We sneak to Don's, and Genia sees a dude leaning up against Don's door. Genia doesn't recognize him, Teras can't see, Talbot sees they are dressed in the armor of the townsguard. We remember Seb told us he posted guards along the tunnel entrances. We speak to "Harry," who says he's spoken to Don and his men but otherwise nobody else has come through. Talbot impresses upon him the importance of staying loyal to Seb, and Teras tries to glean some information out of him. 

We try to follow Zansy's trail, unsuccessfully. It heads out of town straight along the Westward trail. Zephyr sends us the cipher information and Talbot recognizes the landmark as Owlbear Rock. It's about a 6-8 hour journey from town. 

As we head back to the lawkeepers, the town seems even more shut down than normal. People are peering at us through shutters (general peering, not specific). 

Seb is gone, has taken Terry (female elf solider, fairly veteran) to the druids. The other two are receiving medical treatment still.

We debate about the best course of action for some time, and then head out. Zephyr uses a cloak to hide her face. We don't see anything suspicious as we approach. There's two people milling about, and two people guarding the mill. 

Tablot will peel off near the lumber yard and wait to see Mr. Berr leave, the rest of us are heading to the forest. The edge of the river/lake is about 50 ft from us, then runs about 150 ft, then turns into a pond, then ~100ft from that is the entrance to the lumber yard.

We hear some growling and barking, Talbot sees Paul and Mr. Lena and some other employees he recognizes from the day. They are all preparing to fight. Roughly 20 ft between us and the river are a set of footprints - small, humanoid. 

Viri tracks the footprints for ~10 minutes North, following the river. She sees a bunch of infrastructure for lumber workers to load logs into the river. The footstep disappear at the base of a large oak tree (~30-40ft tall, very branchy and leafy). Roughly 30ft away from the clearing where the river ends. This is where the meetup is supposed to take place. She sees some small bits of bark that appear to have been knocked off the tree.

Zephyr turns into a cat to go find Mr. Berr. She waltzes towards the entrance, and one of the workers notices her and calls into the building, "Hey Gur, that cat you saw the other day might be back!"

A male half orc comes out to observe. Zephyr pretends to limp. Gur is not convinced it's the same cat. He thinks the cat is too fucked up and needs to be put down. He snaps her neck. She turns back into Zephyr.

Roll initiative!
