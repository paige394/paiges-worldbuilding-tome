### Bulleted Notes
Present: Viri|Nate, Scarlet|Haley, Teras|Paige, Genia|Abby 

- Viri, Teras, and Genia make small talk at the inn. Viri learns that the pair came into town to meet someone Genia knows, and Genia and Teras learn a pared down version of how Viri and Scarlet met.
- While stepping out of the inn to get drinks, Scarlet reveals to Viri that she's nervous about people recognizing the insignia on her armor because of what happened when they rescued Tiri.
- Scarlet also tells Viri that the insignia is for an order of monster hunters that uses "unconventional methods" (blood rites) to give them an advantage.
- Sky and the priest who recognized the cult symbol find the book entry referring to the "Cult of the Six-Pointed Star," who believes the world will be born anew in an apocalypse and wishes to make that happen.
- Sky also asks the priest about a "good of birth," which prompts the priest to talk about the Prime Tetrid, the name for four gods present at the foundations of the universe.
- As they all sleep, the party dreams...
	- Teras dreams of a mysterious stranger who tells him he's been asking the right questions but getting the wrong answers. He is gifted a "Coin of Truth."
	- Viri dreams of Kylian being tortured and branded by mysterious figures, but cannot make out the symbol he is branded with.
	- Sky dreams of a battle between two towering, possibly divine entities. They are "called to battle" and gifted a spell scroll.
	- Genia dreams of herself dancing at the harvest festival, but a mysterious smoke spreads out from her and kills the entire town. She is gifted a tome and a spell scroll.
	- Scarlet dreams of a captured werewolf being killed on an alter, but at the last moment the scene turns to show an innocent human being killed instead.
- The next morning, Genia and Teras receive their payment in exchange for the amulet and Teras gets a glimpse of the woman who pays them (gnome, purple hair, purple eyes).
- Viri tries to ask Zippy about her dream, but he has taken Tiri on a short adventure and isn't at home.
- Sky tells Genia and Teras about the cult symbol over breakfast, and both Teras and Genia recall a moment where they have seen or heard of this cult.
- Bam greets the party once they are all gathered and confirms he will be able to pay them what he promised.
- As the party walks to the creepy tower, Sky mentions the gossip about the judge that was killed a few towns over and is now being replaced by a retired Lightkeeper.
- Viri reveals that Scarlet knows some information about the Lightkeepers, but all she reveals is that some of them operate on "misguided principals."
- We arrive at the tower, and Viri watches someone send a messenger bird to the north.
- A mysterious and illusory figure greets us at the tunnel entrance, and welcomes us as "the mighty seven. Born again, and here at last."
- We brute force our way through three swinging axes, jamming them with a crowbar and the two statues guarding the entryway.
- The first room we come to has a fountain of greyish liquid, which the illusory figure tells us to drink from.
- Teras and Sky do not, but Viri, Scarlet, and Genia do and are able to see translucent, glowing footprints headed up a staircase with the cult symbol over the door.
- The next room we come to is a grid of weighted tiles. The illusory figure tells us, "Your ears must be as keen as your eyes if you wish to meet your fate! Have you been paying attention?"
	- Row 1: Tile 7 (the mighty seven).
	- Row 2: Tile 4 (my master has plans "for" you).
	- Row 3: Tile 2 (two statues).
	- Row 4: Tile 3 (three swinging axes).
	- Row 5: Tile 1 (one fountain).

### Edited Long-Form Notes 
Present: Viri|Nate, Scarlet|Haley, Teras|Paige, Genia|Abby 

We pick up where we left off: early evening in the inn the party has been granted free rooms at. Viri continues to make small talk with Teras and Genia, asking what they came into town for. Genia offers, "I was in town to meet someone and Teras was looking for some information." When Viri asks what sort of information, Teras just shakes his head and says he just follows Genia where she goes.

Genia and Viri continue to make small talk about Dragon Piss and how Viri might like the woman Genia came here to meet. She then asks Viri what *she* came here for, and Viri responds simply "Fate." She gives a very-pared down version of the story that she appeared out of nowhere near Scarlet and that's how they came to travel together. Scarlet comes to sit eventually but doesn't introduce herself. Genia tries to make awkward small talk, introducing herself and Teras and getting Scarlet's name. 

When Genia asks, "Where do we go to find these cult guys?" Scarlet seems to take offence at calling them cultists as that's a "heavy term to be throwing around." Viri mentions something to Scarlet about the creepy tower southwest of town. That seems to be where we'll be heading in the morning.

Scarlet and Viri head across the street to the tavern to grab some Dragon's Piss, and while there Viri asks how Scarlet is doing. She says she's very nervous about how they left their last location, and she doesn't want anyone to recognize the insignia on her armor. "If they find out I'm here and not where I'm supposed to be and the guy I was supposed to be with is dead..." Viri asks for clarification on what the insignia means, and Scarlet divulges that they are an order of monster hunters that uses some "unconventional methods" to bolster themselves. She's just a human and, well, she can't fight the likes of a werewolf without some help.

When questioned further about her methods, Scarlet says it's easier to show than tell and pulls Viri into an alley to invoke a blood rite. Viri asks how many of her order there are, but Scarlet says she's not high enough up to know that. "There's a lot of different orders (of the lightkeepers) that follow a lot of different gods to fight monsters." She does go on to explain that she was taken into the order by a lightkeeper named "Seb," who took her under his wing and trained her up before leaving somewhere on his own. She also reveals to Viri that the man they killed was a Captain in the Lightkeepers.

(Sky|Alex arrives)

Sky, while at the other inn tending to the wounded, managed to find a priest who has seen the symbol the cultists were wearing before. They head to one of the temples with said priest to look for the book that they saw the symbol in. "Old Croake's Mythes and Tales," found relatively quickly with the two of them searching together. Under the six-pointed purple star there is an entry for the "Cult of the Six-Pointed Star" that says they believe the world will be born anew in an apocalypse, and they are trying to help bring it about. 

The priest says they don't really know anything more, but they will continue to search for information and if Sky finds their way back here they will happily tell them what they learn.

Before they depart, Sky asks the priest if they've heard of a god of birth that wants to "bring life in." The priest says they are familiar with the "Prime Tetrid, but they're more of an academic subject than a religious one." The Prime Tetrid is the name of the four gods at the foundation of the universe. The other gods can be seen or channeled by people, but nobody has ever seen or been able to channel these prime "gods," so their legitimacy is in question.

Sky goes to the temple of Repara to pray.

Viri comes back with Dragon Piss for her, Scarlet, Genia, and Teras. Sky pulls a college hello and asks if they can sit with the gathered group and introduces themselves. Viri introduces herself, Genia introduces herself and Teras. Scarlet does not introduce herself.

Viri offers up a Dragon's Piss to Sky, who nervously accepts. Viri, Scarlet, and Genia take their shots and make CON saves. Genia fails, Viri and Scarlet pass. She experiences a deep burning sensation that lingers all night. Teras does not take the shot Viri offers up, so Viri grabs it and her and Sky do theirs simultaneously. Sky NAT 1s and passes out immediately, but Teras catches them before they smack their head too hard and leans them forward against the table.

Viri heads to the tavern to play a few tunes and earns some coin before turning in for the night. Everyone else heads straight to bed. Teras opts to sleep on the floor instead of the bed, which distresses Genia to no end. He will take the pillow to placate her but stays on the floor.

> DREAMS!!!
> 
> **Teras - A Visit From A Stranger**
> Teras wake up in the inn, no longer on the floor but in a bed. It's still dark outside. At the end of my bed, floating in the air, I see a small source of light. A small, smoldering red circle that denotes the end of a cigarette. The light moves as I hear an exhale and smoke slowly filters out of an obscured figure's mouth. 
> In a deep, guttural voice, "Teras, you've been asking the right questions. And I'm not sure you're getting the right answers." 
> Teras hear a soft *clink* as the figure flips a coin towards him. Teras catch the coin in his hand. It's gold. On one side is a woman's head with a blindfold, the other side is a set of scales. 
> 
> Teras startles awake in his room at the inn, on the floor, clutching a gold coin in his hand.
> 
> **Viri - A Man In Chains**
> Viri is in a dark room, no windows, no source of light, drifting and feeling disembodied. A light springs forth, a ring of torchlight from a chandelier on the ceiling. On a raised stone tablet, chained, bound, and stripped, is Kylian. Viri watches as two hooded figures appear from the left and right. The figure on the left, as Kylian begins to scream and protest, pulls out a strip of cloth and stuffs it into his mouth. The figure on the right carries with them a glowing, red-hot brand. They press it down onto Kylian's chest just above his heart, and Viri squints to try and make out the symbol but is unable to.
> 
> Viri wakes up in a cold sweat in the inn.
> 
> **Sky - A Holy War**
> Sky stands in a grassy field, surrounded by plains of white-yellowish grass. The air is thick, like there is a storm stirring, and the sky is blood-red. Two figures, hundreds of feet tall, stand in the field, locked in battle. One is a humanoid of glowing bright white light holding a radiant longsword. The other is an incorporeal black shadow that writhes around, effortlessly dodging the attacks of its opponent. 
> Sky hears horns, trumpets being blared as a battle begins to rage around them. Soldiers in golden gleaming armor astride similarly outfitted horses rush in around them. "For honor, for glory!" They shout. From the other side, warriors in all black armor on black, nightmarish horses. 
> A figure in blinding golden armor on a golden horse pats Sky on their left shoulder. They hand over a scroll, "Onward solider! The fight is now!" Sky's feet begin to pull them into battle.
> 
> They wake in the inn, grasping a spell scroll.
> 
> **Genia - A Life Now Lost**
> Genia looks down on a familiar scene from a disembodied view. A stage in the town of Thistleton, decorated for the fall harvest festival. She watches herself on the stage, in a gorgeous white dress. In the crowd Genia sees her parents, her friends, and at the back of the stage stands the mayor with his wife and son. Genia watches as she begins to dance, but instead of the dress beginning to turn into ash, as the scene should go, it begins to turn black as a shadow creeps up from the bottom like ink in water. As Genia continues to spin, lost in the rhythms of the dance, the shadows fills the dress and then begins to spin outward. It spews like smoke, getting bigger and bigger, twisting like a cyclone, and finally reaches a size enough to pass through the bodies of the mayor, his wife, and his son, who fall like puppets with their strings cut. Unaware, Genia continues to dance, the shadow weaving its way through the rest of the crowd, through Teras and Baxter and nameless others, felling each person as they are touched by it. 
> 
> Genia wakes in the tavern. There is a tome on the nightstand next to her, as well as a spell scroll. A note in the tome says, "Good work. Here's another present for you."
> 
> **Scarlet - A Man Now A Beast** 
> Scarlet stands in a forest under a full moon. In front of her sits a stone table, parallel to the ground. Strapped down to the table is a werewolf. Scarlet feels the cuts and bruises on her body from fighting and capturing this beast. It is writhing against its chains, but unable to move. Two clerics of Lumen appear on either side of it. One holds the holy symbol of Lumen, the golden sun, aloft, and it glows as they chant under their breath and the werewolf begins to weaken and stop fighting his chains. A third cleric appears at the head of the wolf and raises a silvered shortsword, poised to stab the beast through the heart. With a flash, the scene changes. Two hooded figures stand, holding up their hands, dripping in blood, chanting under their breath. A blackish-red energy seeps from them, entrapping what is no longer a werewolf, but a plain human down on the stone table. The third hooded figure drives the silvered sword into the heart of this innocent.
> 
> Scarlet awakes in the inn.
> 
> DREAMS!!!

In the morning of the next day, Genia and Teras head to the other tavern (Buckets) to meet the woman who hired them to steal the amulet. She is indeed there, slumped down at a table with a hood pulled firmly over her head. Genia slides her the amulet and quips, "I hope you don't need a shot this early in the morning." The amulet disappears under her hand, and 10 gold slides across the table to Genia. "Anything else you need from me?" No response. 

Teras buys two shots of Dragon's Piss and slides one to the woman. She takes it, shoots him a look, and slumps back down. He can see that she is a female gnome, purple hair, and purple eyes as well. No visible insignias on her clothes. Not nobility, but clean and well-dressed.

Scarlet buys some new clothes and then sits alone to eat breakfast. 

Viri heads to Zippy's as soon as she wakes up from her dream. The house is empty, and there is a note on the door that says, "Taking Tiri on a short adventure to teach her some new skills. Be back in a few days." Viri kicks the door, "Fuck!"

Sky, Genia, and Teras sit at a table together for breakfast. Genia asks Sky if they noticed anything about the attackers when they stayed back to help the injured. Sky informs her of the symbol on their robes, and that they appear to be cultists in the "Cult of the Six-Pointed Star." It is not the first time Sky has seen this symbol - it was also on someone pursuing a package they had to deliver to Zippy. Genia asks who Zippy is and Sky tells them that he is a wizard who lives in town, but "he doesn't look much like a wizard."

Genia & Teras double NAT20 on history checks. Teras recalls a controversial incident in Dirshire (at the smallest arena he fought in). In a human versus human fight, which are not supposed to be to the death except in Thistleton, a human was killed. Teras was up next to be taken to the arena and saw the surviving competitor wearing the six-pointed purple star. Genia thinks her grandparents may have been in this cult.

At some point, the group all settles at the same table, at which point Bam barges in. "Hello heroes! Are you ready to take on the day?" Genia is the only one to answer with a timid yes. He confirms that he will be able to give us 10 gold each upon receiving proof that the remaining cultist is dead. He has also prepared our horses for the journey, but Teras seems afraid at that prospect and since the tower is close the others all agree to walk.

Scarlet walks fast to be at the head of the group so she doesn't have to talk to anyone. Genia and Teras bring up the rear, walking as a pair. Sky chatters to Viri as we walk. They say that it sounds like there may be other attacks from the cult in other towns, mentioning the judge that got killed and how a lightkeeper named Sebastian is replacing him. Sky hates that some random lightkeeper who is not a cleric or follower of the god of judgement is being assigned to the role of judge. 

Viri says that Scarlet would know all about the Lightkeeper, and asks about Sebastian specifically. Scarlet says she doesn't know him, but asks why Sky thinks he isn't qualified to be a judge. Sky repeats their point about how a judge is supposed to be a follower of the god of judgement.

Teras asks Viri why she asked Scarlet specifically about the lightkeepers, and Viri says they ran into a lightkeeper together and it seemed like Scarlet was on the run from them. Scarlet and Viri tell them about Tiri, and how Lightkeepers killed her parents. Scarlet says the majority of the lightkeepers operate on "some misguided principals." Viri asks Teras if he has any experience with Lightkeepers, and he says, "None I want to talk about."

As we come over the top of the last hill, we see the tower we are headed for. It stands roughly 60 feet tall, built in a spiraling double-helix shape, and has a classical pointy roof. Viri is the only one to see a figure step out onto the balcony at the top and send a bird Northward. 

There are two doors visible from our point of approach. On the west side, there is a large metal door built into the hill quite separate from the tower. On the tower itself, a small covered entry sticks out towards the north. We opt to enter in the door attached directly to the tower.

As we approach the entrance of the tunnel, the hallways torches alight and we see two stone statues holding blades crossed in front of the entrance. We hear 3 blades begin to swing in the corridor. At the back of the hallway, a figure appears. An individual with pale white skin, a mask covering the left side of their face, wearing a cloak with the hood pulled down. The cloak looks very much like the clothing of the cultists we fought in town, and we see the purple star insignia pinned on the front left lapel. Their face is shimmering, and we can tell this person is an illusion. 

A voice calls out "Ah, the mighty seven. Born again, and here at last. You may think me your enemy but you all have been more helpful than you can imagine. My master has great plans for you. Much hangs in the balance. Much more than just a few gold. Proceed, and prove yourselves worthy." The statues swing their swords out of the way, planting them in the ground. Then they turn from facing each other to facing straight outward.

Teras sticks his crowbar into the first swinging blade to stop it, doing so successfully. Sky gives him Guidance as he passes. 

Genia offers up her crowbar, but this one breaks in half when Teras tries to wedge it into the second axe.

Viri begins examining the hall for the mechanism controlling the blades. In the ceiling, a rod runs down the hallway. It is disjointed so the blades all swing independently of one another. There is a small opening in the ceiling where the axe comes out of. Viri tells Teras to try and hit the mechanism in the ceiling, but it is at too awkward of an angle. 

Viri then suggests moving the statues into the path of the axe, which Teras does easily with Viri's help. The second axe smacks into the statue but can't continue to swing. Teras and Viri move the other statue into the path of the final axe, but Teras isn't quite fast enough at dodging out of the way the second time and takes a minor amount of damage.

With all three blades stopped, the party moves forward and enters a central room. There is a font in the center, and entrances to the stairways on either side. The right staircase is filled with rubble, the one on the left is clear and has the cult symbol above the doorway.

"Take a single sip and see the truth of our world friends. What has been and what must be is visible to those who open themselves to him." The same voice we heard before calls out.

The font is filled with a grey liquid. Scarlet sticks her finger in, to no ill effect, and smells it (it smells metallic). Genia uses her alchemists tools to investigate what this fluid may be. She cannot determine what it is because she's never encountered it. However, it is not any of the common poisons and it doesn't seem like a potion with a clear magical effect.  Scarlet and Genia dip their fingers in and try it. Viri follows suit. Sky abstains. Teras objects.

All three of them bend over as they are wracked with darkness and strobing lights. They hear a deep, guttural sound. Sky and Teras notice their eyes are now yellow. After a brief freak out and a medicine check, Teras releases Genia's head and calls her stupid.

Those who drank from the fountain can now see yellow spectral footprints on the ground heading up the cult staircase. The party follows the footprints up the stairs and into a new room. The room is divided by a grid of square tiles. There is one row on either side of the room at ground height, and eight rows of weighted panels sunk into the floor between them. A low fog hangs in the room, slightly obscuring the sunken tiles.

We see the same illusory figure on the other side of the room. "Your ears must be as keen as your eyes if you wish to meet your fate! Have you been paying attention?"

**Row 1.** Teras pushes down tile 5 with his javelin. An arrow shoots out of the ceiling into the center of the tile. Genia pushes tile 7 with her sword. The first row of tiles disarms. (The mighty seven.)

**Row 2.** Viri, with her temporarily enhanced sight, can see footprints on tile 4. Sky pushes it tentatively. The second row of tiles disarms. (my master has plans "for" you)

**Row 3.** The fog is too thick to see any footprints on this row. Viri attempts to push tile 1 with mage hand, but the tile is too heavy. She steps onto it instead and takes an arrow in the leg. 
The voice calls, "Did you forget about your gracious hosts?"
Teras pushes tile 6 with his javelin. An arrow fires back and hits him.
The voice calls, "Not us! Those who let you in!" 
Teras pushes 2 with his javelin. The third row of tiles disarms. (Two statues guard the entrance.)

**Row 4.** Viri can see a slight glow on tiles 1 and 3 in the next row. Teras pushes 3 with his javelin. The fourth row of tiles disarms. (Three axes prevent easy entry.)

**Row 5.** Genia can see a slight glow on 1. She pushes it. The fifth row of tiles disarms. (One fountain to drink from.)

**Row 6.** The fog is too thick to see anything on row 6. Scarlet borrows Teras' javelin and pushes on tile 2. The sixth row of tiles disarms. (Two staircases to climb up.)

**Row 7.** Scarlet pushes 6 with the javelin. The seventh row of tiles disarms. (A six-pointed star on the correct staircase.)

**Row 8.** Scarlet pushes 8 with the javelin. The eighth row of tiles disarms. (Eight rows of tiles to traverse.)

Scarlet thanks Teras for the javelin and hands it back to him. The party presses onward.

Fin.

### Raw Notes 
Missing: Aoife, Sky, Zephyr

It is early evening.

Viri asks Teras and Genia what they are in town for. Genia gives Teras a look and opts to just say "I was in town to meet someone and Teras was looking for some information." Viri asks what sort of information and Teras says, "I really just follow her around."

Genia and Viri make small talk about Dragon Piss and how Viri might like the woman she came here to meet. She then asks Viri what *she* came her for, and she responds "Fate." She briefly mentions that she appeared out of nowhere near Scarlet and that's how they came to travel together.

Scarlet comes to sit eventually but doesn't introduce herself. Genia tries to make awkward small talk, introducing her and Teras and getting Scarlet's name. Teras walks away to order 3 more pot pies. Scarlet orders an ale.

When Genia asks "Where do we go to find these cult guys?" Scarlet seems to take offence at calling them cultists as that's a "heavy term to be throwing around." Viri asks Scarlet about the creepy tower, which we saw SW of town as we came in. That seems to be where we're heading in the morning.

Viri is mid-to-late-20s, Scarlet is early 20s. (clarification Q from Paige)

Scarlet and Viri run across the street to grab Dragon's Piss and while there Viri asks how Scarlet is doing. She says she's very nervous about how they left their last location. She deosn't want anyone to recognize the insignia on her armor. "If they find out I'm here and not where I'm supposed to be and the guy I was supposed to be with is dead.." Viri asks what "her order is anyways," since I'm not from around here. "We follow a god of light, but the order I'm part of in particular were monster hunters but we use some unconvential methods to bolster ourselves." She's just a human and, well, she can't fight a werewolf without some help.

Viri asks what methods, and Scarlet says it's easier to show than tell and pulls viri into an alley to invoke a blood rite. Viri asks how many of you are there, but Scarlet says she's not high enough up to know that. "There's a lot of different orders (of the lightkeepers) that follow a lot of different gods to fight monsters."

(Alex/Sky arrives)

Scarlet: "When I was 15 or 16 there was this guy named Seb who was part of the order I joined and he thought I had potential and took me under his wing and trained me and then he left and I kind struck out on my own. That guy we killed was a Captain of the Lightkeepers." Pre-lightkeepers she was a quasi-foster-kid traveling from church to church.

Viri asks if she's ever thought of disguising herself, which Scarlet answers by saying "with what?" As she left all of her belongings behind when they fled.

Sky is in the non-main-st inn treating to the wounded, overheard a convo about the murder of Bishop Adam Moresec in Wheaton (judge/cleric of god of judgement). Sky heads to one of the temples with the priest who had seen the cult symbol before to look for the book that they saw the symbol in. 

"Old Croake's Mythes and Tales" found relatively quickly with the two of them searching together. Under the six-pointed purple star there is an entry that says: they believe the world will be born anew in an apocalypse, and they are trying to help bring it about. "Cult of the Six-Pointed Star"

The priest says they don't really know anything more, but if sky finds them again they will dig into it and tell them what they learn.

Sky asks them if they've heard of a god of birth that wants to "bring life in." Yes I'm familiar with the Prime Tetrid, but they're more of an academic subject than a religious one. The name of the four gods at the foundation of the universe. The other gods we actually know about and can channel them, but these prime "gods" nobody has ever seen them or been able to channel them...ever. If you want to research more there are many people more knowledgeable than I.

Sky goes to the temple of Repara to pray but nothing remarkable happens.

Viri comes back with Dragon Piss for her, Scarlet, and Genia. Sky pulls a college hello and asks if they can sit with us. They introduce themself to the group. Viri introduces herself, Genia introduces herself and Teras. Scarlet does not introduce herself.

Viri offers up a Dragon's Piss to Sky, who nervously accepts. Viri, Scarlet, and Genia take their shots and make CON saves. Genia fails, Viri and Scarlet pass. She experiences a deep burning sensation that lingers all night. Teras does not take the one Viri offers up, so Viri grabs it and her and Sky do theirs simultaneously. Sky NAT 1s and passes out immediately. Teras catches them before they smack their head and just leans them forward against the table.

Everyone heads to bed. Teras opts to sleep on the floor instead of the bed, which distresses Genia to no end. He will take the pillow to placate her but stays on the floor. Viri heads to the tavern to play a few tunes and earns some coin, then goes to bed. Sky takes a bath. 

DREAMS!!!

Teras - I wake up in the inn but in a bed. It's still dark outside. At the end of my bed, floating in the air, I see a small source of light. Glowing red, a small circle (a cigarette). The light moves as I hear an exhale and smoke slowly filter's out of someone's mouth. In a deep, gutteral voice "Teras, you've been asking the right questions. And I'm not sure you're getting the right answers." I hear a *twink* as they flip a coin towards me. I catch the coin in my hand. It's gold. On one side is a woman's head with a blindfold, the other side is a set of scales. 

I wake up for real, with this coin in my hand.

Viri - You are in a dark room, no windows, no sources of light, feeling disembodied. A ring of torchlight on a chandelier comes on in the ceiling. On a stone tablet at a 45deg angle, strapped down, is Kylian naked. You watch as two hooded figures enter from the left and right. On the left, as Kylian begins to scream and protest, pulls out cloth and stuffs it into his mouth. on the right, carries with them a glowing red-hot brand attached to a metal poker. They press it down onto Kylian's chest just above his heart. You can't make out the symbol.

Viri wakes up in a cold sweat in the inn.

Sky - IN a grassy field, but the grassy field is a white-yellowish color. The air is thick like you are in a storm. The sky is blood-red. Two gigantic figures stand in the field, locked in battle. One is a humanoid of glowing bright white light holding a similarly glowing longsword. They are hundreds of feet tall. The other is an incorporeal, black, shaodwy ifgure that writehs around and dodges the attacks of the glowing white figure. You hear horns, trumpets being blared as battle begins to rage around you. Soldiers in golden gleaming armor on horses with similarly goolden armor rush in around you "for honor, for glory!" The other side, warriors on horseback in all black armor on black nightmarish horses. A figure on your left pats you, in goolden armor on a golden horse. They hand you a scroll, "onward solider! the fight is now!" Sky's body pulls them into battle.

They wake in the inn, holding a spell scroll.

Genia - You look on from a disembodied view. You watch a stage in the town of thistleton, decorated for the fall harvest festival. You watch yourself, on the stage, in this glowing, gorgeous  white dress. The crowd looks on, you see your paretns, your freinds, the mayor at the back of the stage with his wife and son. You watch as you begin to dance, but instead of the dress beginnings to turn into ash, from the bottom it begins to turn black as a shadow creeps up as you watch yourself unaware continuing this dance. As you're spinning in the rythms on the stage the shadows fills the dress and then begins to spin outwards from you,. getting bigger and bigger and finally rushing out to pass through the bodies of the mayor., his wiefe, and son and they fall to the ground dead. As you continue to dance the shadows weaves its way through the rest of the crowd, through Teras and Baxter, felling each one as they are touched by it. 

Genia wakes in the tavern. She sees a tome on the nightstand next to her, as well as a spell scroll. A note in the tome says, "Good work. Here's another present for you."

Scarlet - You're in a forest. It is a full moon, there's a stone tablet at 90deg. Strapped down to the stone tablet is a wereowlf. You can feel the cuts and bruises on your body from fighting and capturing this beast. It is writhing against its chains, but unable to move. Two clerics of lumen stand on either side of it, holding the holy symbol of lumen, the golden sun, aloft, and it's glowing as they chant under their breath and the werewolf begins to weaken and stop fighting his chains. A third cleric steps forth at teh head of the wolf and raises a silvered shortsword, ready to stab it through the eheart of the wolf. With a flash, you are watching a different scene. Two hooded figures holding up their hands, dripping in blood, chanting under their breath. A blackish-red energy comes from them and holds a regular human person down on this stone tablet. The third hooded figure stabs down the silvered sword into the heart of this innocent.

You wake.

DREAMS!!!

Genia and Teras head to the other tavern (Buckets) to meet the woman. We see the slumped figure in the corner. Genia slides her the amulet. "I hope you don't need a shot this early in the morning." The amulet disappears under their hand. 10 gold slides across the table to Genia. "Anything else you need from me?" No response. 

Teras buys two shots of Dragon's Piss and slides one to the woman. She takes it, makes eye contact, and slumps back down.

Female gnome, purple hair, purple eyes as well. No visible insignias on the clothes. Not nobility, but clean and well-dressed.

Scarlet buys some new clothes and then unless Viri is downstairs, sits alone. 

Viri heads to Zippy's immediately in the morning. The house is empty, and there is a note on the door that says "Taking Tiri on a short adventure to teach her some new skills. Be back in a few days." Viri kicks the door, "Fuck!"

Sky, Genia, and Teras sit at a table to eat in the morning. Teras does not take breakfast (porridge). Genia asks if they noticed anything about the "people's" bodies when they stayed back to help. Sky informs her they are actually cultists. It was 150-year-old cult. It is not the first time Sky has seen this symbol (they hold it up to show us). it was also on someone pursuing a package we had for Zippy (Genia: who is that?).  A wizard who lives in town, but Sky remarks that he doesn't look much like a wizard.

Genia & Teras double NAT20 on history checks. Teras recalls a controversial incident in Dirshire at the smallest arena I fought in. A human-v-human fight, which are not supposed to be to the deasth except in Thistleton. I was on deck to fight and I saw, walking down the hall, someone in a person-v-person fight who killed the person they were fighting. I caught a glimpse of the six-pointed purple star on that person's cloak.

Genia thinks her grandparetns were in this cult.

Sky thinks they are bad. (Hot take alert.) 

Viri sits alone in the room, Scarlet eats breakfast alone. Viri heads downstairs after some time.

Bam barges in. "Hello heroes! Are you ready to take on the day." Genia answers a timid yes. He has checked the books and he can indeed give us 10 gold each, he just needs proof that they're dead. Could be a cloak, a head, etc. 

Teras seems unsure about taking horses, so they decide to walk. It's not much further and everyone else doesn't seem to mind.

The square is still pretty muddy and trampled over, but the town is already looking more calm. We head out to the tower on foot.

Scarlet walks the fastest to be at the head of the group and so she doesn't have to talk to anyone. Genia and Teras bring up the rear, walking as a pair. Sky chatters as we walk. It sounds like there may be other attacks from the cult in other towns. They tell us about the judge that got killed and how a lightkeeper named Sebastian is replacing him. Viri says "Scarlet would know all about that." Sky hates that there's a very specific god for judgement and a cleric of that god must take that role, and some random lightkeeper is assigned to the job and not another cleric of the god. 

Viri calls up to Scarlet. "What do you know about a lightkeeper named Sebastian?" "Why are you asking, do you know them?" Viri tells Sky to repeat what they just told her.

Scarlet says she doesn't know him but asks why he isn't qualified to be a judge? Sky says there's specific people for that!

Teras asks Viri why ask Scarlet aout the lightkeepers, she says they ran into a lightkeeper together. Scarlet was on the run from Lightkeepers, it seemed. She tells them about Tiri, and how Lightkeepers killed her parents. She says the majority of the lightkeepers operate on "some misguided principals." Teras gets a PTSD flashback at that and Viri asks if he has any experience with Lightkeepers. "None I want to talk about."

Double helix tower with a pointy roof and balcony. Roughly 60 feet tall. As we come over the top of the last hill, Viri sees a figure on the balcony send a bird out North. 

On the west side there is a large metal door built into the hill (separate from the tower). There is a little tunnel entrance to the tower that sticks out North. We decide to go into the tower door.

As we approach the entrance of the tunnel, the hallways torches alight and we see two stone statues with blades crossed in front of the entrance. We hear 3 blades begin to swing. At the back of the hallway in an opening, an individual with pale white skin, a mask covering the left side of their face, wearing a cloak but the hood is down. The figure is wearing clothes very similar to the cultist, and we see the purple star insignia pinned on the front left lapel. Their face is shimmering, this person is an illusion. A voice calls out "Ah, the mighty seven. Born again, and here at last. You may think me your enemy but you all have been more helpful than you can imagine. My master has greats plans for you. Much hangs in the balance. Much more than just a few gold. Proceed and proves yourselves worthy." The statues swing their swords out of the way, planting them in the ground. Then they turn from facing each other to facing straight outward.

Teras has heard of the mighty seven, ancient heroes that have sealed the darkness away.

Teras sticks his crowbar into the first swinging blade to stop it. Sky gives him Guidance as he passes. 

Genia offers up her crowbar, but this one breaks in half when Teras tries to wedge it.

Viri begins examining the hall for the mechanism controlling the blades. In the ceiling a rod runs down the hallway. It is disjointed so the blades are all separate. There is a small opening in the ceiling where the axe comes out of. Viri tells Teras to try and hit the mechanism in the ceiling, but it is at too awkward of an angle. 

Viri suggests moving the statues into the path of the axe, which Teras does easily. It smacks into the statue but can't continue moving. I do it again for the second axe, but don't quite dodge fast enough and take one pt of damage.

We enter the room. There is a font in the center, and entrances to the stairways on either side. The right staircase is filled with rubble, the one on the left is clear and has the cult sign on it.

"Take a single sip and see the truth of our world friends. What has been and what must be is visible to those who open themselves to him." The same voice we heard before calls out.

The font is filled with a grey liquid. Scarlet sticks her finger in, to no ill effect, and smells it (it smells metallic). 

Genia uses her alchemists tools to investigate what this fluid may be. She cannot determine what it is because she's never encountered it. However, it is not any of the common poisons and it doesn't seem like a potion with a clear magical effect. 

Scarlet and Genia dip their fingers in and try it. Viri follows suit. Sky abstains.

All three of them bend over as they are wracked with darkness and strobing lights. They hear a deep, gutteral sound. Sky and Teras notice their eyes are now yellow. They can see yellow spectral footprints on the ground running up the cult staircase.

After a brief freak out and a medicine check, Teras releases Genia's head and calls her stupid. The party follows the footprints up the stairs and into a new room.

We see the same shadowy figure on the other side of the room. There is one row of 5x5 tiles on our side and on the other side. In between that is an 8x8 pattern of weighted panels in the floor. We can see numbers on our side.  A low fog hangs in the room, slightly obscuring them. The figure, still an illusion, says "Your ears must be as keen as your eyes if you wish to meet your fate! Have you been paying attention?"

Teras pushes down tile 5 with his javelin. An arrow shoots out of the ceiling into the center of the tile. Genia pushes tile 7 with her sword. The row of tiles rises up to become level with the ground and ceases to be weighted.

The yellow-eyed folks: Viri can see footprints on tile 4 in the next row. Sky pushes it tentatively. The row rises and becomes level.

There is too much fog on the next row to see footprints. Viri attempts to push 1 with mage hand, but the tile is too heavy. She steps onto it and takes an arrow in the leg. 

The voice calls, "Did you forget about your gracious hosts?"

Teras pushes 6 with his javelin. An arrow fires back in to their row and hits him.

The voice "Not us! Those who let you in!" 

Teras pushes 2 with his javelin, and the floor rises to level.

Viri can see a slight glow on tiles 1 and 3 in the next row. Teras pushes 3 with his javelin and the floor rises to level.

Genia can see a slight glow on 1. She pushes it and the floor rises to level.

The fog is too thick to see on row 6. Scarlet borrows Teras' javelin and pushes 2 and the floor rises to level.

Scarlet pushes 6 with the javelin and the floor rises to level. 

Scarlet pushes 8 with the javelin and the floor rises to level. 

She gives Teras the javelin back. We begin to move on.

Fin.
