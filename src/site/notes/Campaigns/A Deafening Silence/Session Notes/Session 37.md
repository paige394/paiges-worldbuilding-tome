### Bulleted Notes

### Edited Long-Form Notes 

### Raw Notes

As dinner ends, Viri gets a servant to get "the biggest bottle of wine you can possibly find" while Teras and Genia scheme to speak to the Chef and Talbot prepares to talk to Mr. Berr. Talbot sees the count conversing with the humanoid cactus, but sits upright startled and looks at Mr. Berr, raises an eyebrow, and Mr. Berr nods. The count nods back and then Mr. Berr begins to head for the exit of the ballroom. Talbot follows discreetly.

Zephyr overhears a name in conversation, a halfling man identified as an ambassador for the Empire.

Mr. Berr exits through an upper hallway and turns right. He clocks Talbot just before he enters another room and raises an inquisitive eyebrow, and gruffly says "How can I help you?" Talbot fudges and says he was simply admiring the Count's home, but Mr. Berr says he does not want minor nobles and merchants wandering the house. 

Talbot clocks Mr. Berr's red eyes again, and they remind him of the red eyes of the golem we fought, possessed by Janeus.

Scarlett enters the Count's study, and sees the hilt of a sword mounted above a flickering fireplace. A spirit servant pops into existence and says, "Welcome, Count. Please provide the password to proceed."

Dianna says, "La strigo fluga je la cerpesca."

"Password incorrect. Defense mechanisms activated."

Rollinitative

Rd.1
Scarlett - activates rite of the dawn, attacks a glass golem with rapier (hit, hit)
Glass golems - swing on Scarlett (miss, miss) and Dianna(hit, hit), one shoots a light beam at Dianna (success)
Dianna - disengages, attacks the one on Scarlett (hit/kill)

Scarlett notices that Dianna's dagger pierces the glass, but it doesn't shatter and seems to be regenerating.

Meanwhile, the Count addresses the room to start the dancing. The tables magically lift into the air and begin to stack against a wall for the servants to disassemble.

Viri launches into her first set, to resounding applause from the crowd. Skye and Zephyr begin to dance, Teras and Genia stay for Viri's first set and try to keep an eye our for familiar faces but are unsuccessful.

Talbot apologizes and walks away, and Mr. Berr walks through the door. Talbot loiters for a few minutes.

Rd. 2
Scarlet - tries to pull down the hilt from the mantle (DEX save, pass); a forcefield springs to existence around the hilt 
Golems - Scarlet (miss, hit), Dianna (miss, hit)
Dianna - (miss, hit)

At the end of her number, Viri asks the crowd to gather at the front. She invents crowdsurfing.

She finds Genia and Teras in the crowd, and Teras puts her up on his shoulders so she can look for Kylian (successfully). Viri says she doesn't know what to talk to him about, and Genia and Teras tell her to pretend it's just any other conversation. We all notice the Count exit the crowd and head directly towards us.

The Count congratulates Viri on a stirring performance and introduces himself to Teras and Genia. Teras asks if he and Genia can speak to the chef to compliment him in person. 

The Count addresses Genia directly and asks to dance with her. He says he has heard much about her and has been eager to make her acquaintance. 

As they head off, Teras says he doesn't like any of this. Viri asks if he means Genia dancing with someone else, but he says there's too many people he recognizes.

The Count asks Genia if she's been enjoying the festivities and they make awkward small talk for a few minutes. The Count says he's heard that Genia is a problem solver, but she shrugs it off. He chastises her for starting their relationship without honesty. Genia asks what problems he's heard that she has solved. He says there's no point beating around the bush, and...

Skye and Zephyr continue partying.

The Count says he has a rather longstanding relationship with Thistleton, and the mayor there has told him much about her. He says the mayor has leveled some startling accusations, but also says that he is interested in a more fruitful business relationship, with Genia. He says he can offer her some information about the mayor in exchange for information about herself. He's "not blind to the undertakings of an upstart group of adventurer's in Cape Lamar's sphere of influence, but I am not hostile." The Count insists that he is happy to assist.

Genia agrees to keep him updated on our party's shenanigans in exchange for information on the Mayor's plans, whereabouts, and goings on. He slips her a sending stone.

Rd. 8
Talbot - psychically messages Talbot, Skye, and Genia for help ; attacks Mr. Berr (hit, miss)
Scarlett - death saving throw
Golems - Dianna (miss, miss)
Dianna - nabs Scarlett's rapier and attacks Mr. Berr (hit/kill)
Mr. Berr - decomposees

Viri approaches Kylian and asks if she can join him. He congratulates her on her performance, and she congratulates him on his jousting prowess. She asks about his relationship to the count as asks if he was a fighter where he came from. He says he was self-taught. She says it's a shame about his hand, but he feigns ignorance and says it's just a glove. She challenges him to take it off, and when he does it reveals nothing abnormal.

She tells him to "Cut the shit, this isn't you." He tells her it might be best if she drink a little less during her next performance.

As he walks away, Viri tell him Ingrid would be ashamed of him. He hesitates almost imperceptibly, then walks away.

The Count tells Genia he would like to begin their arrangement now, but Genia gets Talbot's message. She asks if there is somewhere more private they could go, but the Count says he can't leave his own ball and the sounds of the dancefloor will mask their conversation well. Genia tells him she has it on good authority that something is happening in his lounge and she needs access, and the Count hands her a keycard.

Rd. 9
Talbot -  tries to stabilize Scarlet and gives a more detailed description of the lounge's location; attacks a golem (hit)
Scarlet - death save; stabilized
Golem - Dianna (hit, miss)
Dianna - golem (hit, hit); asks Talbot 'long live Cape Lamar?'

Rd. 10
Talbot - golem (hit, hit/kill); the forcefield around the mantle disappears

Talbot throws some shade at Scarlet. Dianna grabs the hilt of the sword right as Teras, Genia, Skye, and Zephyr approach the doorway.

They ask what the fuck is going on, Talbot praises Scarlett and gives them his version of events.

Dianna asks us what we're all doing here, and we say Talbot called us as backup.

Skye heals Scarlett, who wakes up and asks Dianna where she's going, and tells us it's the hilt of the sword. 

We block the door. Dianna says she was set to a task by her employer, but Scarlett can tell she knows more than she's letting on. Scarlett says she doesn't mind it leaving the Count's possession, but she would like to know how she can trust who it's going to.

We squabble over who is actually getting it, and Scarlett insists she will simply follow Dianna to wherever it is being taken. Dianna says she is not perturbed at the prospect of making more allies.

As we leave the room, we hear panicked screams from the ballroom yelling, 'Assassin!'
