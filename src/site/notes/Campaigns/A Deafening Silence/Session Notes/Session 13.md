### Bulleted Notes
- Marsian Seeple is being sent to Wheaton by Yenna Kharrun for three purposes: 1) Investigate the druid/lumber company feud; 2) Investigate the murder of the former lawkeeper; 3) Investigate stories of The Seven and their artefacts.
- The Sphinx tells Viri about Mordresh
	- He is real, and seeks to conquer, enslave, and kill
	- Neither truly alive nor truly dead and cannot be defeated by traditional methods 
	- The Seven locked him in "The Blind Beyond," but he escaped to Corash and wants to return to our realm
	- Viri was a test subject for Mordresh's return, and Kylian got swept up in the transportation magic somehow 
	- Need to gather the artifacts to unlock the door to defeat Mordresh, either here or on Corash 
- Viri returns to the basement, and we all regain spells/skills as though we had long rested (not HP)
- "Talbot Envers" appears in the basement (Marsian)
- Other hallway - dead druid child with stab wounds, two suits of armor next to four sarcophagi
- Tomb reads "Thank You For Your Service" in various languages, one sarcophagus reads "For the sake of our worlds, turn back now" in Celestial 
- Opening the sarcophagus reveals 4 wights, which are defeated 
- Voices coming from a stairway behind the sarcophagus 
- Sub-basement is a large room with 10ft tall pillars in the corners carved with runes, a distant sound of water behind the back wall, and four ghostly, child-like individuals who appear to be happily playing hopscotch
- The Dwarf has magical gauntlets that read "Kerek"
- Kerek wants Viri's lute, and when she refuses to give it he prepares to attack

### Edited Long-Form Notes 
Absent: Paige|Teras

Cape Lamar – in a tall building, in a huge office, standing alone is Marsian Seeple (Winter Eladrin, from a noble family in Cape Lamar) wearing a slate gray suit with sturdy boots and a rapier, not sociable, now the foremost PI and bounty hunter (rogue, psychic blade). Longstanding relationship with Yenna Kharrun, getting pushed towards Wheaton for kuku wood. Traveled to Wheaton as a noble to demonstrate awareness of the situation, but really to investigate the murder of Lawkeeper Adam Morsek and the Count (Berr??) and his plan with the druids, but really really to investigate the stories of The Seven and their artefacts. Kerek Klavenna was one of the seven, who lived in Wheaton. Marsian steps into a teleportation circle to get to Wheaton.

Viri’s in a mist realm version of the basement, with a chimera/sphynx that greets her. The force locked away is Mordresh, the eternal tomb does exist. The tomb is less a prison and more just a locked door. The Seven locked him behind it, the door led to an incorporeal place called "The Blind Beyond" that gods can traverse. Mordresh found his way to a new world, Corash (Viri’s home), but wants to return to our world. Mordresh found a group to get him back, and Viri was a test subject. But backdoors exist to get in. Need to gather the artifacts to unlock the door to defeat Mordresh, either here or on Corash. Kylian is somewhere, got caught up in teleporting Viri.

Mordresh is a being of almost pure evil who wants only to conquer, enslave, and kill. Neither truly alive nor truly dead and cannot be defeated by traditional methods.

Viri blinks back in and we reset spells and skills like a long rest.

Marchian teleports into the basement (yellow stone hallway), introduces himself to the group as Talbot Envers.

Dead druid child in this empty room in a pool of blood with lots of stab wounds, two suits of armor next to tombs.

Child’s been day at least a day, but no more than 2 days, pull the bodies together to keep a good pick up point.

Tomb is particularly old, with message written in elvish on the tomb (Elvish, Draconic “thank you for your service”, Dwarvish “thank you for your service”, old dialect Common), text in the top of the sarcophagus in celestial “For the sake of our world, turn back now.”

No rust or dust on the suit of armor, likely not stationary for a long time.

Try to open up the sarcophagus, pop it open and the 4 lids open up, wights exit the tombs.

We beat them all!

There are voices and light behind the sarcophagus and down some stairs.

Animated armor was all plate mail, could be worth money and a rework to Sky size. Left dead friends upstairs.

Sub-basement room - 10ft tall pillars in corners with runes on the stones, distant sound of water beyond the back wall, 4 individuals making joyous sounds like that of children and a hopscotch setup, 3 pale white wispy small ones and 1 a built, short, armored Dwarvish person, black shriveled corpse in the corner, likely a child’s body.

Dwarf person has magical gauntlets with runes in draconic “Kerek.” The ground begins to shake under out feet, and the runes glow purple. Kerek wants his lute, and starts to wind up against Viri.

Cape Lamar – in a tall building, in a huge office, standing alone is Marsian Seeple, winter eladrin, from a noble family in Cape Lamar, slade gray suit with sturdy boots and a rapier, not sociable, now the foremost PI and bounty hunter (rogue, psychic blade). Longstanding relationship with Yenna Kharrun, getting pushed towards Wheaton for coocoo wood. Travel to Wheaton as a noble to demonstrate the awareness of the situation, but really to investigate the murder of Lawkeeper Adam Morsek and the Count (Berr??) and his plan with the druids, but really really to investigate the stories of The Seven and their artefacts. Kerek Klavenna was one of the seven, who lived in Wheaton. And Marsian steps into a teleportation circle to get to Wheaton.

Viri’s in a mist realm of the basement, with a chimera / sphynx “hello again Viri” The force locked away is Mordresh, the eternal tomb does exist. The tomb is less a prison and more just a locked door, the seven locked him behind it, the door led to an incorporeal place The Blind Beyond (astral sea??) that gods can traverse. Mordresh found his way to a new world, Korash (Viri’s home), but wants to return to our world. Mordresh founded a group to get him back, and Viri was a test subject. But backdoors exist to get in. Need to gather the artifacts to unlock the door to defeat Mordresh, either here or on Korash. Kylien is somewhere, got caught up in teleporting Viri.
