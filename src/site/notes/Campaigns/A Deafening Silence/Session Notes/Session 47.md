Gravity disappears when the monster does, so Viri and Teras begin to fall. Skye and the rod hold firm, and we are able to get out.

Teras suggests digging some of the ketramine up, but Talbot says it could explode. We then decide to try and fix the elevator.

Chain Shirt returns and lays a bunch of items on the ground: a robe, a satchel, and a large red-and-black scaled egg. Teras picks those up, and gives Chain Shirt some manacles and a steel mirror to please him. Talbot asks first if he can check the hole the SH was in.

As Chain Shirt leaves, we investigate the items in front of us. Zefir says the egg is definitely rare, but isn't exactly sure what kind of creature it is. Talbot identifies the bag as a bag of holding. We have no idea what the robe is, but Scarlet puts it on.

Chain Shirt returns and tells us that there are duergar below, and that they are mean to Chain Shirt. 

Sky casts [[locate-object\|locate-object]] and can sense that the staff is below us, within 1,000 feet. Down and to the East. Then they cast [[locate-creature\|locate-creature]] to track Kylian, and senses that he is in a similar direction as the staff, moving in a square like pattern.

We decide to fix the elevator and short rest while we do so. It is not quiet, but we do get the elevator working at the end of two hours. We all hop on and head down to the third floor.

As we lower down, we see a hoarde of duergar waiting for us, and with them a bloodied soldier with his hands tied behind his back wearing Cape Lamar's colors. The leader of the dwarves steps forward and asks who speaks Dwarvish, and Genia raises her hand. 

He asks us why we came, and Genia says we are on a rescue mission. The dwarf asks if we mean the captive, and Genia says yes. He says it is not going so well then, and asks what the captive was here for. Genia says exploring. He tells us no more exploring, turn around and go home. She asks if we can take the captive with us. He asks what we have to offer.

Genia's bartering skills are not very good. She threatens him. Talbot can tell it is getting heated and telepathically steps in. He pretends to be Lumen and intimidate the dwarves. It works. He is willing to give us the guy.

The captor dwarf steps forward and says, "I cannot believe we show mercy to two groups of surface dwellers in the same day."

We realize there are two more people from the party still down here, so once we safely receive him, we attack. Roll initiative!
