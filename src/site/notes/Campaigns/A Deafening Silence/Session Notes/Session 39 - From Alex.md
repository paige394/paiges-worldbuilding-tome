### Bulleted Notes

### Edited Long-Form Notes 

### Raw Notes

Diana was killed by Yenna, the king was killed, the adalusian empire is at war with cape lamar

All residents of Cape Lamar will be drafted

Talbot finds the body of Gregor the watch detective with a throat slashed, staff and security all killed

They’ve taken the Falante cloak, which is from a group islands off the coast of cape lamar, quite possibly taken by the cultists, probably the cape of kaizen

Nothing else seems stolen, we move towards Opheus’s office. Opheus is dead 15 minutes ago. He experimented on birds that could understand the melody of the music box and they died readily.

Falante cloak has potent transmutation magic from the islands, discovered in pristine condition (HIGHLY MAGICAL)

Everyone’s throat is slit, but the other office with lights on has a dart in their chest. Teras licks the dart

Cloaked. Dagger. Slashed. White. Eyes.

Music box desk notes song Nerys

Busy focused notes music box, powerful wizard runes spell

“killing people’s fine if you’re sad”

Lots of commotion the next morning

Assassins not associated with the empire

The count is a supporter of the conflict

Killed with the venom of a western red viper, it’s the cult

Yenna wants us to go to the mines of chideken, trying to follow lieutenant balfist and trying to suppress whatever evil the dwarves unearthed

Vizix gives viri a pouch of red dust, which corrodes metal. It’s a rust monster that corrodes non-magical metals

Jorge is the king of the hill in the underground fighting ring, and smiles as teras challenges him to a fight
