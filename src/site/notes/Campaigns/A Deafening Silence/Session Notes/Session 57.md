### Bulleted Notes

### Edited Long-Form Notes 

### Raw Notes
Teras skims Odron's journal for any mentions of Kaisen and doesn't find any, but he notices the earliest date in the journal is over a hundred years ago.

In the morning, Teras makes huevos rancheros for the gang. He feeds some to Vincent and gets advantage on his next rat check. Talbot says we should all have a chat, and everyone agrees. Teras asks if he and Genia can take a walk first.

Teras tells Genia he doesn't want to do this - have this talk at all. He asks what she knows about her patron. They have a hard conversation about who Teras trusts, who Genia trusts, and what all happened yesterday. Teras tells her about Latch as a cautionary tale, but Genia still seems to think that her patron wouldn't hurt her. 

The "inside" crew discusses the same. The general consensus is that they're concerned about Genia's patron. They trust Genia and think it was a bad move, but aren't mad at her necessarily. But her patron is just not someone we know the motives of, and those motives could conflict with the party at some point (and already have).

Genia's patron sends a message that we should check the journal entry for the day of Bartholomew's harvest festival.

Teras and Genia reenter the cabin. We have more hard talks. Talbot asks Genia to be clear about her patron's motivations, or if she doesn't know them to find out what they are. She says outright that if her patron asked her to hurt any of us, she wouldn't.

Scarlet asks that next time we have a conversation about things her patron asks her to do that are in conflict with our goals. Sky asks her what else her patron has asked her to do, and Genia says it mostly seems like interpersonal things rather than world-shaking things.

Teras suggests that we look for Odron's journals. Genia reads the current journal for the harvest festival entry. The day after the festival, there is an entry that describes Cornelius' death, that he seems to have transformed into a werewolf, and that the group involved in killing him included an albino minotaur. The tone seems to be angry, upset, and vengeful. 

Viri finds Odron's earlier journals among a bunch of other books in his cabin. There are five apiece, which each cover about a hundred years. A quick skim of the first journal (nearly 650-750 years ago) is written in a bit more archaic elven and sylvan, although Viri can piece out that there seems to be even earlier tomes in the series.

Sky recalls that the events with the seven happened around 700 years ago.

As we prepare to head towards the Druid's tomb, we hear a knock at the door. Teras opens it enough to see a medium-height person wearing blueish robes and a red waistband over full, bronze-ish plate armor. A hood is raised, but empty. Gloves and shoes indicate the presence of other limbs.

Teras says hello. The figure greets him by name. Teras asks who they are, and they say "I am Avaloch. Perhaps I could come in and explain?"

Teras asks how they know who we are. Avaloch says they still keep up on the goings on of their forest. They appreciate our efforts to return the protector of the forest to a healthy state. Avaloch bestows the Plate of Caergorn to us, in the hopes we will do what is good and right. They tell us the artefacts we seek are exceptionally powerful, and grow in power when used in combination. But they also warn that the artefacts are also a great burden, which we must bear.

Teras says cool, tell us about Odron, your skull, and his tears. He doesn't have many answers. Avaloch gives us the plate.

Sky attunes to the plate. The rest of us decide where to go next. The Cloak would require a trip to the Isle of Xernia, the Shield requires us to fight Lord Lighthead or whatever the fuck, and we don't know where the Drider Queen and the Staff are. Sky suggests we head to Thistleton.

We settle on heading to the Academy to do a little research about the Seventh artefact, Avaloch's tears, and stock up. From there, Thistleton is a three day journey. 

Viri checks in with Kylian while Sky attunes. He says he's up for some travel. She asks if he's okay after the "incident" at Ms. B's Den of Debauchery. He says he doesn't even remember it.

Talbot receives a message from his patron. "Preparations almost complete. Hostilities likely happening soon. Status report." He responds, "New artefact required. Course of action still murky."

Sky finally finishes attuning. They get full plate armor, and once a day can cast nature guardian (?) spell.

Teras and Genia look outside for anywhere else Odron may have stashed his last journal. We don't find the journals, but do find 13gp, which Teras splits evenly among the party.

We head to the academy. By the end of the day, we make it out of the forest. We can see the Academy in the distance. /pu
