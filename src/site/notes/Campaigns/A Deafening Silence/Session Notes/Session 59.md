### Raw Notes
Teras sells his broken greataxe and gets his Bloodrage greataxe repaired.

Viri's sugar daddy Edward gives her THE music box, and when she inquires where he got it he said a courier delivered it yesterday. Vincent says Gensea directed it to us somehow???

He leaves her with one last piece of advice: to be careful, that the items we are messing with are wanted/known by the gods themselves.

Genia and Teras talk about where to go next. Teras asks what Genia thinks will happen after she kills the Mayor, and she says she's not sure. They talk about the past and what could have been. Ultimately, they settle on Thistleton before heading to Traxeldorf.

Viri whips out the music box, and we all freak out. Genia casts comprehend languages to try and read the runes/text inside the box. Teras copies them down so the box is not open but she can still read the runes.

She can't glean the text precisely, but they remind her of the runes associated with the blight spell.

Teras buys a Cloak of Many Fashions, with 10gp loaned from Talbot.

Scarlett and the rest of the gain head to the library, investigating who may be protecting the sword shards we have.

Genia looks for more history of the Seven, specifically the stuff she saw in the dream.

Viri researches Nerys, the figure from the music box. She finds myths on Mortis, the god of death, and his wife Nerys. It's not more than we knew before. She does have a revelation that the music box resembles the amp that the Earl gave her.

Sky researches the Isle of Xernia. It was the original island where humans, dwarves, gnomes, non-elves etc. landed and setup shop. One of the oldest non-elven settlements. It has been mostly abandoned and bears the brunt of a lot of harsh weather from the sea.

We wake up refreshed and start our journey to Thistleton. Our first day progresses fairly smoothly. Overcast, but no rain. As we settle down for the night, Viri and Kylian chat. He says he gets a pit in his stomach when he hears about people working for the gods and he doesn't know why, but he tells her to be safe. 

On third watch, Sky faintly hears a heavy thudding noise, like something gigantic is shaking the earth. They and Viri wait for a few minutes, but the noises seem to fade. As we wake up, Sky sees a brief flash of light near Genia.

Sky tells Genia about it and Genia checks her bag. Nothing seems to be missing.

Our second day of travel also seems uneventful. Much sunnier, though the weather starts to turn in the afternoon. As we round a corner, we see the Count floating about fifteen feet in the air.

He claims he's here to talk to us about the artefacts we're recovering. Sky and Teras can both tell he doesn't sound like the Count we've met before. Teras can also tell he is translucent - not like an illusion, but like a ghost of some kind.

The count offers to take care of our "enemies" in exchange for our new artefacts, which Teras rebukes by throwing a javelin. It flies through the Count's form, and he summons the undead forms of Janeus and Vincent as some cultists step out of the shadows.
