### Edited Long-Form Notes 
Arkividros - a warm spring evening on the continent. Two horses race into the town of Bartholomew from Whispering Ridge in the Northeast. The sun has not yet risen, and these two have clearly ridden through the night to arrive here.

Atop the first horse is a very large, fair-skinned human with long, blonde, curly hair braided tightly down their back. They wear a simple green robe with an ornate flower on the chest, an ornately carved staff displayed proudly at their hip, and a faint rattling can be heard from under the cloak. The other horse holds a much smaller figure - a young, bright-eyed halfling girl with deep chestnut hair (also braided), gently clinking mail armor, and a javelin strapped to their saddle.

They slow as they come into town, deciding to head to the nearest inn to see if they can find someone they are looking for. As they do, the taller human, Sky, sees a sign inscribed "M. Lancaster" that points towards a lit building at the end of the road.

Sky walks directly up to the front door, Aoife following close behind. As they knock on the door, a net drops down on them from above. Sky is captured and hoisted into the air, but Aoife manages to dash out of the way. As Aoife moves to free Sky, they hear creaking from inside the house.

Sky calls out, "We are looking for Master Lancaster." 

A tall elf wearing a stereotypically pointy wizard's hat and blue nightrobe swings open the door. Their hair is sticking out at odd angles from underneath the hat, and a five o' clock shadow covers the bottom of their face. Despite the sleeping attire, it does not look like they have slept in quite some time.

"You have a package for me? What are you doing down there?" 
"I've been entrapped in your ropes." Sky points out the obvious.
"Well it's a common practice to defend your home from intruders in the middle of the night." He defends.

The pair explains that the person who was originally charged with delivering the package was being hunted down, which is why they rode through the night and have arrived at such an odd hour.

The elf introduces himself as "Muzira Lancaster, but you can call me Zippy." He invites them in and takes the package.

"You brought this from Forsheka?" He asks.
"Well, I'm not sure how far Forsheka is." They reply.
"He's very far gone."

Zippy opens the package to reveal a heavy, leather-bound tome with metal embellishments, titled in Celestial, "Forsheka's observations of the end of the world."

Lancaster remarks that "he" always was quite melodramtic, but begins to read right away. He "hmmms" and "aha!s" and "I see's" as he reads.

Aiofe decides to walk through the house and open random doors. She finds nothing of note.

Sky asks Mr. Lancaster if this book is truly about the end of the world, and in reply Zippy (who really hates being called Mr. Lancaster) says that "This could be bad."

He explains that Forsheka was a famous human cleric that served "one of the regular" gods. At some point, he claimed to begin hearing from Tracktotis, (?) god of "creation and order and everything." Shortly after beginning to hear this voice, Forsheka lost his mind, began having disturbing visions, and locked himself in a tower.

"Or it could just be the ramblings of a crazy person." Zippy continues to read and then pauses.

"Do you think that's blood?" In the middle of a sentence there is a slash like the pen was dragged away, and there is a spatter of red at the bottom of the page that is definitely blood.

Aoife demands to see it but Zippy dismisses her, saying "There's children's books in the bathroom." She insists she isn't a kid. Zippy verifies this fact with Sky, and then shows her the book. There are many more pages in the tome but they are empty save for a bit of soaked-in blood.

Zippy says that the final pages describe "dark forces on the isle of Zernia" (an abandoned island in the harbor to the Southeast of Whispering Ridge) and then a bunch of stuff that is difficult to make out. 

Then, "He think's he's started to see the locations of the magical items of The Seven!" Zippy notes that, if true, this would be a very interesting find.

Sky asks what "The Seven" and their magical items are.

>The Seven - A long time ago, there was an evil ancient force that went by the name of "More Flesh, Morakesh, Moraspesh, or something." Seven super warriors answered the call of good and locked this evil force in a prison forever with a magical spell. 
>
>Sky interjects. The guy they took the package from that almost died told them that "Mordresh is coming."
>
>The Seven dispersed the magical items used to seal Mordresh all over the world so nobody could unlock the ancient evil.

Each of the items was shown to Forsheka in a vision, and are as follows:
**The Plate of Cair'goren** - in Rentlam Forest ( you're gonna want to talk to Cornelius, Zippy notes).
**The Staff of Marzul** - in the mines wayyy to the Southwest.
**The Sword of the Slayer** - Zippy appears puzzled by what he is reading - this one has two locations. "Blade" is in the foothills of Bartholomew, "Hilt" is in .... this is where it trails off.

Sky asks if Cornelius is a cleric of Repara? Zippy corrects him that he's a druid, and he will be in town later today to perform the Blessing for the festival.

Zippy says he will continue to read the book, but Aoife and Sky are welcome to check in tomorrow if they want to know more.

Sky thanks them and says he would like to get some sleep.

-

Two more individuals on horseback ride into town. A human woman in her early twenties with dark red hair, green eyes, and a dusting of freckles wearing silver scale mail rides atop the first horse. She has a small creature tucked into the folds of her cloak, and nearly every other square inch of space seems to have some kind of weapon strapped to it. She sways rather precariously on her horse trying to balance it all. Beside her, a tall girl with pale skin and contrastingly black wardrobe. She is clad in black leather boots and pants, a plain black tunic, wears her black hair in a shaggy mullet, and is adorned with black piercings, chokers, and heavy black eyeliner. A rapier is strapped to her hip, and a lute with sharpened edges is strapped across her back. As they ride, the girl lights a joint and begins to smoke it.

This is the second day of their journey to Bartholomew, so although they arrive in the early morning there seems to be less urgency than with the first group. Scarlet has been here before, so she knows exactly where Zippy Lancaster's house is. They pull up to the house, whose door is still swung wide open. They can see Zippy sitting on the staircase reading a large book, and two strangers standing awkwardly in the foyer.

Aiofe sees them arrive and calls out, "Don't come in here, it smells!" 

Scarlet knows Zippy but not the other two. She chides Viri, telling her to put out her joint because it's rude to smoke in someone else's home, not to mention there's a child here. The child pipes up and asks Viri if she can try the joint.

Scarlet greets Zippy warmly, holding the child on her hip opposite the two strangers. It is not a human child. Sky can tell it is a small, scaly, red Kobold.

Sky tries to worm their way out of the house. "Sorry, we were on our way out. We'll be on our way."

Aoife has no such sense of urgency to leave. "Who are you?"

Scarlet tells her it's none of her business, but Zippy also seems confused and asks who she is. It seems that Scarlet and Zippy have met before, and she is a friend of a friend, though we don't get their name.

Viri also does not seem to mind the strangers, who she waves at as she steps into the house.

Aoife tries again, this time with Viri. "Who are you?"
"Viri."
"You smell like smoke. Can I take a drag?"
"You're funny." Viri chuckles but walks past.

Aoife, frustrated, follows Sky out of the house.

Scarlet turns to Zippy. "Viri and I have just experienced a strange phenomenon and neither of us know what it is."
Zippy replies, "My specialty!"

Scarlet gives a brief description. She had an encounter in "the Kobold house," though she does not go into any detail about any fighting or what the outcome of it may have been. Suddenly, the wind whipped itself into a tornado, the trees began to shake, then Viri appeared next to her.

Viri explains that she was in a castle doing her "classic grave digging." Opened up a little tomb, it started swirling around her and she got sucked up into the sky. A talking lion with wings appeared and told her she was needed here, and she showed up by Scarlet. (Zippy suggests it was probably a Sphinx.)

"Some guy was gonna kill this kid, so I did what I had to do."

Zippy asks if he can take a hit of the joint. "You must have that good shit."

"Come a little closer." Zippy stands and walks right up to Viri to begin smelling her.
She pushes him and asks what he's doing.
"Interplanar travel always leaves a unique smell that I am honed in assessing."

He sniffs out (literally) that she is from "around here, just not from around here you know." It is undetermined if Viri is fully from a different plane, as he explains there is "a little something there" but it is not strong enough to indicate a "full other plane."

"Right plane, wrong continent," he explains further.

Viri has never heard of Arkividros. She's whispers the continent she is from to Zippy, who says he's never heard of it.

Zippy finally asks about Tiri, the Kobold. Scarlet says they found her on the outskirts. Zippy says her kind normally stay out of those parts, then asks if she wants to learn magic. She excitedly says it sounds cool, but looks up at Scarlet who says it's ok for her to stay with Zippy.

"We were gonna try to find her family but if you need an apprentice, sure."

"Tiri you gotta stop asking for permission, just do it." Viri imparts some final wisdom.

Tiri does not ask permission and tries to snag the blunt. Scarlet admonishes them, and Tiri seems to listen.

Zippy says he will take care of Tiri and start looking into this continent. He takes the final hit of the blunt and eats the roach.

On her way out, Scarlet tells Zippy that "if anyone from the Lightkeepers comes looking for me, I wasn't here, and I haven't been for years."

Viri, on her way out, asks, "There was a fella with me when I got sucked away, what are the odds he came with me?"
Zippy says odds are pretty good they're "here, but not here" much like Viri.

The pair leave to find an inn for the morning.

-

Later that morning, a pair heads into town on foot from the northwest. A large white minotaur with a black lightning-shaped scar across his chest and wearing ragged, loose clothes leads the pair. A sturdy steel ring with a bit of broken chain hanging from it clinks softly in his nose as he walks. Next to him, a girl in her mid-teens who would blend in quite easily if it weren't for the beast beside her. She wears her brown hair in a choppy pixie cut and is dressed in ragged traveler's clothes with her hood pulled up to conceal most of her face. They each carry a single weapon and a large, tattered pack on their backs, and both are quite dirty from their travels. 

Teras has been doing research on the Lightkeepers, and his brief conversations have granted him the name "Bert." An older human man, retired Lightkeeper who works as a traveling merchant based out of the merchant's guild in Bartholomew.

It is not terribly early in the morning, so the pair get a few odd looks from the other folks about town. Both keep their eyes darting about shiftily as they walk, but keep their heads down.

The pair arrive at the merchant's guild without incident. It looks well-kept, but not ostentatious. There are a few sub-buildings with storage areas scattered around the building too - a combination of storage and sleeping quarters. 

Teras knocks loudly, and a halfling wearing business casual attires opens the door. He asks how he can help, and the girl, Genia, speaks up and asks after a man named Bert. The halfling says there is a man by that name, but Genia and then Teras both try and fail to be covert in their reasons for asking after him.

Finally, Teras just tells him they are buying, but only from Bert. "We've heard good things." The halfling winks and goes to get him.

Bert is wearing a deep v-neck, and looks like a very questionable businessman. When he hears they are buying, he invites the pair into his room. Teras follows first, with Genia protectively behind him.

A very awkward conversation ensues in which Teras attempts to ask the man about the Lightkeepers without giving up any information or using the word "Lightkeepers." He tries the following tactics:

Teras asks if he recognizes the branded ring on his horn. He says he does not.
Teras ask if he knows the name Baxter, and holds up a single gold coin to sweeten the pot. He says he does not, but he knows of the Coliseum.

"I used to be a Lightkeeper, but I didn't want to play the game the way it needed to be played. I took a quick out."

Genia asks how he could enjoy the Coliseum if he supposedly left the Lightkeepers over *their* unsavory practices. He says he assumed the gladiators all fought for coin.

Teras asks him, intimidatingly, how he thinks the monsters arrived in the ring?

After much more awkward back-and-forth during which Teras tries to sus out if Bert is corrupt or not and in which Bert probably thinks the pair is going to try and kill him, they get a few more answers.

He does not specifically recognize the man Teras is asking after, but he heard of an underground ring of Lightkeepers who did jobs on the side for extra coin. There was one piece of shit specifically who bragged about all the money they had gotten from the shady shit. "Plintus Zinstra," she settled down in Whispering Ridge.

All three of the people in the room agree to pretend that interaction never happened.

Genia says she needs to meet someone but doesn't think it would be wise for them to show up together. Teras offers to go in first. 

Despite the early hour, the tavern is pretty crowded with people dressed in wreaths who look like they're celebrating. Teras orders the cheapest drink available and plants himself so he can see an individual slumped over, alone, at a table.

Genia heads in and pulls her hood down, approaching the bar. A tall, skinny, half-elf male asks what she wants. She asks for two shots of Dragon Piss. It is radioactive green. She carries both shots to the person at the table and sits across from them.

"The forest is beautiful this time of year." She says as she sits.

The figure, still slumped, reaches out their arm and lays an open hand on the table. Genia pushes the shot into their open hand. They take the shot.

The hood falls back, revealing a young female gnome with blonde and purple hair. She wears a button down shirt and slacks with a hooded traveling cloak, although her traveling attire is considerably nicer than Genia's.

"I have a mission for you. 5 gold now, 10 gold for delivery of the item, 5 more gold for your discretion." The woman tells Genia. "There's a druid in town for the festival. Wears an amulet. Emerald green, kinda like the Dragon's Piss. Acquire it and 15 gold is yours. He is sleeping in the inn on main street tonight after the festival. You can get it when he's sleeping, or at the festival. Whenever. I'll be here tomorrow morning."
"Can I ask what you want with it? I'm gonna do it regardless."
"Don't get into this line of work if you wanna ask questions honey."

She slams her head back on the table. Genia taps her and asks for her 5 gold. The woman coughs and Genia realizes the 5 gold are already in her pocket.

Outside the tavern, Genia gives Teras the broad strokes of the assignment. The pair decides to get a room at the inn as they decide on a plan to steal the necklace.

-

Aoife and Sky and Scarlet and Viri all happened to end up at the same inn. As they independently head down for breakfast, they each notice the other pair.

Viri says she wants to go ask the strangers what they were up to. Scarlet doesn't care to engage, so Viri heads over to Aoife and Sky on her own.

She asks what they were at Zippy's for, and they explain their encounter with the original package deliverer. Viri seems surprised that they took up delivering a random package to a random man they didn't know, but Aoife says the original delivery man was very convincing.

Viri then asks what was in the book. Sky explains the visions of the Seven's magic items, and that the book was supposedly about the end of the world.

Aoife returns Viri's question, asking what her and the other woman were doing at Zippy's. Viri gives a brief description of suddenly appearing near Scarlet in a house with a man trying to kill the kobold and how they fought the man and escaped together. Scarlet knew Zippy, and that he may be able to help, and Viri didn't really have anything better to do.

Awkward small talk ensues in which Aoife reveals she is a ranger, Sky reveals they are a cleric, and Viri "reveals" she is a bard by pointedly mentioning the lute on her back. Sky chats idly about the festivals and then says they want to head to the temples. The conversation idles awkwardly.

Never deterred by social convention, Aoife asks Viri what kind of exploring she was doing when she got magicked away. 

Viri tells them that she had heard of a necklace rumored to make you an incredible singer, that belonged to one "Todro Pine." Her and a man named Kylian went to go find it, but then both got zipped away. She is eager to find out what happened to Kylian.

Aoife reveals this is the first time she's ever left her hometown, so she probably isn't the best person to have an incidental sighting of a strange man. Sky wishes her luck on her search, and then the three of them disperse - Sky and Aoife heading to the temples and Scarlet and Viri heading to Zippy's.

-

There are three temples on the main street: one for Gensea, goddess of knowledge; one for Repara, goddess of planting and the harvest; and one for Lumen, god of light (and also the patron deity of the Lightkeepers).

Sky first tries the temple of Repara, but finds it temporarily closed and so heads to the temple of Lumen. A human priestess in the temple says Repara's temple is likely closed because the holy people are all attending the festival.

As Sky thanks the woman for the information, they fall to their knees as a deep voice, accompanied by a blinding white light, screams and damages Sky. The priestess rushes over and asks if they are ok, saying they must have a strong relationship with Lumen to be affected in this way. Sky stands, seemingly back to normal, thanks the priestess, and they and Aoife head outside to attend the festivities.

-

Scarlet and Viri knock on Zippy's door, but the net trap has not yet been disabled. Viri gets caught in the net briefly before Tiri and Zippy greet them at the door. Tiri shows off her magic (she can snap her fingers to make sparks, "So I can light the joint!"), and Zippy praises her ability to pick it up so quickly.

Zippy says they were about to head to the festival - it's basically just an excuse for people to get drunk and then a druid blesses the crops. He invites Scarlet and Viri to join them before cryptically asking Tiri if she would like to travel in style.

He materializes a broom for himself and Tiri, and offers one to Scarlet and Viri, who accept.

Zippy receives a raucous round of applause as he lands at the festival - it seems like he's a town favorite.

-

Genia and Teras book a room at the same inn the druid is staying at. Teras thinks he can sniff out which room the druid is in, and narrows it down to three. He knocks on each, getting no response. He tries all three doors, but only one is unlocked. It does not look particularly druid-y. 

After they each take a quick bath, the pair head to the festival to start watching for the druid.

-

All six players are now gathered in the central field for the festival. Aoife and Viri clock the other pairs as well as Teras and Genia.

The band swells and a short human in a suit and tie walks out onto the stage. There is a "gold" sheriff's badge pinned to his attire. He is the only member of the sheriff's office. The crowd's excitement picks up. He vamps quite a bit before introducing Cornelius Bloom.

He looks much the same as when Genia and Teras last saw him. Only Sky clocks the emerald amulet roped around his neck and tucked under his cloak. As he begins to cast his blessing, Sky and Aoife begin to hear rapid hoofbeats approaching the festival.

We all hear screams and the sound of crunching bones as horses crash into the crowd. The sheriff lets out a piercing cry, and a dagger emerges from his face as a hooded figure steps out from behind him.

We all roll initiative.

Arkividros - a warm spring evening on the continent. Two individuals on horseback ride into Bartholomew from the NE. They rush in, likely very early in the morning (3-4am) as they have ridden through the night.

Sky (very large horse, very large for a human w long blond braided curly hair; simple green robe with a flower on the chest; light skin, faint rattling/clanging coming from under their robe, ornately carved staff kept on their right) and Aiofe (plucky 15-yo halfling, just under 2.5 ft tall, dark brown hair usually braided, hazel eyes; mail armor and a javelin at hand).

They left their previous place in the late afternoon (Whispering Ridge, roughly 25 miles away). They see a sign officially welcoming them to Bartholomew. 

Carrying a package addressed to "M. Lancaster." They decide to head to the inn. As they ride, Sky sees a sign that says "M. Lancaster" and points towards a lit building at the end of the road.

The house has a small shed w a latched door off to the right. Sky ignores it and walks up to the front door, must make a DEX save. Sky saves, Aoife ducks out of the way. Sky is captured in a drop-down rope net. As Aoife moves to free Sky, they hear creaking from inside the house.

Aifoe entangles herself in the rope trap as well somehow. Sky calls out "We are looking for Master Lancaster." Tall, age indeterminate elf with a big tall pointy hat, blue nightrobe. 

"You have a package for me? What are you doing down there?" 
"I've been entrapped in your ropes."
"Well it's a common practice to defend your home from intruders in the middle of the night."

The person who originally had the package was being hunted down, which is why the pair traveled with such urgency.

Muzira (?) Lancaster, but you can call me Zippy. Their hair is disheveled and they have a five o clock shadow. Despite the nightrobe, their eyes are bloodshot and they look haggard/weary.

He invites them in and they follow Zippy into the house. 

"You brought this from Forchezka (?)"
"Well I'm not sure how far Forsheka is"
"He's very far gone"

Bound tome with metal embellishments, titled in Celestial "Forsheka's observations of the end of the world"

"Well he always was so melodramatic." Lancaster begins to read.

Aiofe decides to walk through the house and open doors. She finds nothing of note.

Lancaster INSISTS on being called Zippy instead of "Mr. Lancaster"

Sky inquires if this book is truly about the end of the world.

Zippy says that "This could be bad."

Forsheka - well-known famous human cleric that served "one of the regular ones"; claimed he began hearing from Tracktotis (?) god of creation and order and everything; Forsheka lost his mind, began having disturbing visions, and locked themselves in a tower.

"It could just be the ramblings of a crazy person." Zippy continues to read and then pauses. "Do you think that's blood?" In the middle of a sentence there is a slash like the pen was dragged away, and there is a spatter of red at the bottom of the page that is definitely blood.

Aoife demands to see it but Zippy just says "There's children's books in the bathroom." She insists she isn't a kid. Zippy verifies with Sky, and then shows her the book.

There are more pages in the tome but they are empty save for a bit of soaked in blood.

Zippy says that the final pages describe "dark forces on the isle of Zernia" (an island in the harbor to the Southeast of Whispering Ridge. It is an abandoned island) and then a bunch of stuff that is difficult to make out. Then, "He think's he's started to see the locations of the magical items of The Seven." Zippy notes that, if true, this would be a very interesting find.

Sky asks what "The Seven" and their magical items are.

>The Seven - A long time ago, an evil ancient force that went by the name of "More Flesh, Morakesh, Moraspesh" or something. Seven super warriors answered the call of good and locked this evil force in a prison forever with a magical spell. (Sky interjects - Mordresh? Mordresh is coming.)
>
>The guy they took the package from that almost died told them that "Mordresh is coming."
>
>They dispersed the magical items used to seal Mordresh all over the world so nobody could unlock it.

each item was shown to him in a vision
The Plate of Cair'goren - in Rentlam Forest ( you're gonna want to talk to Cornelius)
The Staff of Marzul - in the mines way to the SW
The Sword of the Slayer - this is the one he trailed off on, Zippy appears puzzled by what he is reading; this one has two locations, "Blade" is in the foothills of Bartholomew, "Hilt" is in .... this is where it trails off 

Sky asks if Cornelius is a cleric of Repara? Zippy corrects him that he's a druid. He will be here later today.

Zippy says he will continue to read the book, but Aoife and Sky are welcome to check in tomorrow if they want to know more.

Sky thanks them and says he would like to get some sleep.

-

Five minutes prior to this, we cut to two more individuals on horseback heading to the same house.

Scarlet (veyr small creature riding on the horse with her; wearing silver scale mail, average height human with dark red hair, green eyes, freckles; late teens early twenties, strapped to the nines; having a hard time balancing everything on this horse) and Viri (5'9" wearing all black leather pants and boots, regular tunic; very pale skin, black mullet, piercings, chokers, eyeliner; lute with very sharp edges on her back and a rapier at her side; lighting "something that she rolled") and a third individual (the small creature).

This is day 2 of their journey to Bartholomew. Scarlet has been here before, so she knows exactly where Zippy Lancaster's house is. They pull up to the house which still has its door wide open. They can see Zippy sitting on the staircase, as well as Aoife and Sky (cleric).

Aiofe sees them arrive and calls out "Don't come in here, it smells!" Scarlet knows Zippy but not the other two. She tells Viri to "put that out bc it's rude to smoke in someone else's home and there's a child here." 

She swings off the horse and grabs the child, who asks Viri "if I can try that." Viri says no.

Scarlet greets Zippy warmly, holding the child on her hip opposite the two strangers. It is not a human child. Sky can tell it is a small, scaly, red Kobold.

Sky "Sorry, we were on our way out. We'll be on our way." She tries to shimmy out.

Aoife "Who are you?"

Scarlet "None of your business."

Zippy "Yeah who are you?"

You know me. 
Oh yeah, Magenta!
No, Scarlet.
The friend of...
Viri "a facist"

Zippy closes the tome but remains seated on the staircase. Sky has left the house but Aiofe is still inside.

Viri waves hello 

Aoife "who are you"
Viri "Viri"
Aoife "you smell like smoke. Can i take a drag?"
"You're funny." She walks past.
"nice to meet you!"

Aoife leaves as well.

Zip "Scarlet my good friend, what can I do you for?"
Scarlet "Viri and I have just experienced a strange phenomenon and neither of us know what it is."
Zip "My specialty"
Scarlet gives a brief description. "We had an encounter in the Kobold house. The wind picks up, tornado, trees shake, then Viri appeared next to me." She does not mention who she fought or what the outcome is.

Viri "I was in a castle doing my classic grave digging. Opened up a little tomb, it started swirling around me and i got sucked up into the sky. A lion appeared and told me I was needed here, and I showed up by Scarlet. This guy was gonna kill this kid so I did what I had to do."
Zippy asks if he can take a hit. "You must have that good shit."

"Come a little closer." Zippy stands and walks right up to Viri to begin smelling her.
She pushes him and asks what he's doing.
"Interplanar travel always leaves a unique smell that I am honed in assessing."
"Alright just hurry up."

He sniffs out (literally) that she is from "around here, just not from around here you know." It is indeterminate if Ziri is fully from a different plane bc there is "a little something there" but it is not strong enough to indicate a "full other plane."

Lion with wings and talked. Zippy didn't realize it had wings. Could be a sphinx?

Scarlet asks if those are actually real.

Viri reveals she's seen it as a kid too. Zippy jokes they just like her bc she's got style.

"Right plane, wrong continent." Viri has never heard of Arkividros. She's whispers her continent to Zippy who says he's never heard of it.

Zippy finally asks about Tiri, the Kobold. Scarlet says they found her on the outskirts. Zippy says her kind normally stay out of those parts, then asks if she wants to learn magic. She excitedly says it sounds cool, but looks up at Scarlet to ask if it's ok.

"We were gonna try to find her family but if you need an apprentice, sure."

"Tiri you gotta stop asking for permission, just do it." Scarlet makes a snippy remark and Viri retorts "You were following a man when I found you."

Tiri does not ask permission and tries to snag the blunt. Scarlet admonishes them, and Tiri seems to listen.

Zippy says "I am very supportive of this team." Scarlet corrects that they are not a team.

Viri "We were definitely a team when I ran that rapier through his face." Scarlet does not appear to want this to be revealed yet.

Zippy says he will take care of Tiri and start looking into this continent. He takes the final hit of the blunt and eats the roach.

Viri "You mentioned suppliers."
Zippy "Go into one of the general stores in town and tell them Zippy sent ya."
Scarlet "Before we leave, do you want me to leave the kid here?" He says yes. "Speaking of the man, if anyone from the Lightkeepers comes looking for me, I wasn't here, and I haven't been for years."

Viri "There was a fella with me when I got sucked away, what are the odds he came with me?"
Zippy says odds are pretty good they're "Here, but not here."
Viri asks for a map.

Viri and Scarlet also leave to find an inn. There are two in town - one on Main St. and one further south.

-

We cut to the morning. Teras and Genea head into town on foot from the NW. Genea looks much the same but now has choppy hair. We roll up around 9 or 10am.

I've been doing research on the Lightkeepers, and my brief conversations have granted me the name "Bert." An older human man, retired Lightkeeper who works as a traveling merchant based in Bartholomew. There is a merchant's guild in Bartholomew. 

There are some people about in the city already. We both look for things we could potentially lift but have no such luck. Unlike other towns, we begin to see some monsterous races. We are still catching a little side eye but no abject terror.

We arrive at the merchant's guild without incident. It looks nice but not ostentatious. There are a few sub-buildings with storage areas scattered around the building too. Combo of storage and sleeping quarters. 

Teras knocks loudly. I stare down at a halfling wearing business casual who opens the door. He asks how he can help, Genea inquires about Bert.

We cryptically tell him we are buying, but only from Bert. "We've heard good things." The halfling winks and goes to get him. I think we are about to buy weed.

Bert is wearing a deep v-neck, looks reaaaal sleazy. He invites us into his room. Teras follows first, with Genea protectively behind him.

Genea says we don't actually want to buy what he's selling. He asks if *we* are the ones selling. Genea offers a leaf. He rolls it up and puts it in his mouth. "Oh good, it's not poison oak."

I ask if he recognizes the branded ring on my horn. He says he does not.

I ask if he knows the name Baxter and hold up my single gold coin.

"I used to be a Lightkeeper, but I didn't want to play the game the way it needed to be played. I took a quick out."

He knows the Coliseum, but not Baxter specifically. 

He left the lightkeeper cause shady things happened, and yet enjoyed the Coliseum? Genea asks. He says he assumed they all fought for coin.

"And how do you think the monsters got there?" I intimidate him.

He is being honest that he didn't like the "shady shit." But he is not specific. 

I ask if he recognizes the man that kills my mom. He says not specifically, but he heard of an underground ring of Lightkeepers who did jobs on the side for extra coin. There was one piece of shit specifically who bragged about all the money he had from the shady shit. "Plintus Zinstra" she settled down in Whispering Ridge.

We skedaddle out of the merchant's guild.

Genea says she needs to meet someone but doesn't think we should show up together. Teras says he will go in first. 

Despite the early hour, the tavern is pretty crowded with people dressed in wreaths who look like they're celebrating. 

Teras looks for loose change on the floor.  A man goes to clang his mug and his coin purse rips. I pocket 1gp 2sp 2cp. There is one table with a single patron, a hooded figure slumped on the table. I order a jug of cheap mead (1 sp) and position myself so I can see the man at the table, expecting this is the man Genea will meet.

She heads in and pulls her hood down, approaching the bar. A tall, skinny, half-elf male asks what she wants. She asks for two shots of Dragon Piss (5 sp). It is radioactive green. She carries both shots to the man at the table and sits across from him.

"The forest is beautiful this time of year."
The figure, still slumped, reaches out their arm and lays an open hand on the table. Genea pushes the shot into their open hand. They take the shot.

A young female gnome with blonde and purple hair - the hood falls back. Button down shirt and slacks with a hooded traveling cloak.

Genea asks if she was expecting her.

"I am, and I have a mission for you. 5 gold now, 10 gold for delivery of the item, 5 more gold for your discretion."
"Is the discretion gold once the job is completed?"
"Yes. There's a druid in town for the festival. Wears an amulet. Emerald green, kinda like the Dragon's Piss. Acquire it and 15 gold is yours. He is sleeping in the inn on main street tonight after the festival. You can get it when he's sleeping, or at the festival. Whenever. I'll be here tomorrow morning."
"Can I ask what you want with it? I'm gonna do it regardless."
"Don't get into this line of work if you wanna ask questions honey."

She slams her head back on the table. Genea taps her and asks for her 5 gold. The woman coughs and Genea realizes the 5 gold are already in her pocket.

We leave and Genea will fill me in. She also gives me 5sp. I ask if we can just kill him. She says no :(.

I didn't see him wearing an amulet 6 months ago.

I propose a ruse. Genea thinks we should wait until evening. We go to get a room at the inn to avoid arousing suspicion.

Aoife and Sky. They wake around 10-11. They both want to grab breakfast first. Sky wants to head to the temple across the street after eating.

"They were pretty cranky weren't they? The people that came after us?" Aoife 
Sky says that doesn't seem unusual. It was very early in the morning.

Scarlet and Viri. They also wake around 10-11. Scarlet eats and plans to head back to Zippy right away. 

The pairs see each other in the tavern portion of the inn.

Viri wants to go ask the pair what they were up to. Scarlet doesn't care to engage. Viri sits at a table with Sky and Aoife. They all introduce themselves.

Viri "So what brings you to town?"
Sky "well some guy came into town bleeding on a horse with a package for Zippy and he gave it to us and we started riding. I think his name was Ralph."
Viri "You guys just went for it?"
Sky "He had a lot of force behind his words, and he was being chased by goblins."
Aoife "We handled them fine."
Viri "What was in the book?"
Aoife "I dunno, a bunch of symbols that didn't make any sense."
Sky "Zippy said it was from some guy, a cleric I think, and it has some locations about specific items. Oh, it was a book about the end of the world!"
Aoife "Why were you there?"
Viri "Scarlet knew who he was and...I didn't really have anywhere else to go."
Aoife "Who was that with you?"
V "The girl? We found her."
A "Where'd she go?"
V "She's back with Zippy."
A "So you just picked up a child off the side of the road and were like "you're mine now?""
V gives a brief description of suddenly appearing near Scarlet in a house with a man trying to kill the kobold and how they fought the man and escaped together. Scarlet is a guard apparently.
A "Why isn't she here now?"
V "Ah you know, she's a guard, very strict and by-the-book."

They tell Viri they're both from Whispering Ridge. Viri asks if the continent has some sort of police force or continental guard.

A "If there was ever any sort of dust-up they'd send me in to handle things."
V "Oh yeah, and what are you?"
A "Just a ranger."
V "So...police?"
They both deny it. Sky says they are a cleric

V "Well, great to meet you both."
S "You never told us what you do!"
Viri points to the lute on her back. "Take a guess."
S "You play music?"
V "Play, write. Travel a bit, meet new people."
A "Will you sing a song for us?"
Viri laughs. "The ambience is totally off here."

Sky chats idly about the festivals and then says they want to head to the temples. The conversation ends awkwardly.

A "What kind of (something) were you doing?"
Viri heard of a necklace rumored to make you an incredible singer, that belonged to one "Todro Pine." Her and Kylian went to go find it but then both got zipped away.
A "What happened to Kylian?"
V "I dunno, I need to find him."
A reveals this is the first time she's ever left her hometown, so she probably isn't the best person to have an incidental sighting.
Sky wishes her luck on her search.

Viri heads back to Scarlet, and they both head back to Zippy.
Sky goes to the temples. Aoife follows Sky.

Three temples:
- Gensea goddess of knowledge
- Repara, goddess of planting/harvest 
- Lumen, god of light (and empire/Lightkeepers)

Sky heads to the temple of Repara. It is temporarily closed. A human priestess in the temple of Lumen says it is likely because they are all outside for the harvest festival.

As Sky thanks the woman, they make a CON save. They hear voices?? Two that intensify in holy sites and a mysterious third one. One might be Lumen?

A deep voice, accompanied by a blinding white light, screams and damages Sky. Sky falls to their knees. The preist asks if they are ok and says they must have a strong relationship w Lumen to be affected in this way. Sky and Aoife go out to the festival. It is very lively and starting to pick up more.

Scarlet knocks on Zippy's door and makes a DEX save. Viri gets caught in the net, Scarlet dodges. Tiri greets them with Zippy. She shows off her magic, and Zippy praises her ability to pick it up so quickly.

She can snap her fingers to make sparks and light the joint.

Zippy says they were about to head to the festival - it's basically just an excuse for people to get drunk and then a druid blesses the crops. He invites Scarlet and Viri to join them.

Zippy steps out and asks Tiri if she wants to travel in style. He grabs a broom from inside, hops on, grabs Tiri, and tells Scarlet and Viri to hop on. Viri does, Scarlet says she'd prefer to walk.

Zippy offers Scarlet her own. Viri says she'll take her own. Her and Scarlet share a second broom. 

Zippy receives a raucous round of applause as he lands, seems like he's a town favorite.

Genia and Teras book a room (3 sp each). Teras thinks he can sniff out which room the druid is in and narrows it to three. He knocks on each, gets no response. He tries the doors but only one is unlocked. It does not look particularly druid-y. 

We both take a quick bath, and head to the festival to find the druid.

All six players are now gathered in the central field for the festival. Aoife and Viri clock us, but don't necessarily register. 

The band swells and a short human in a suit and tie walks out onto the stage. There is a "gold" sheriff's badge pinned to his attire. He is the only member of the sheriff's office. The crowd's excitement picks up. He vamps quite a bit before introducing Cornelius Bloom.

He looks much the same as when Genia and I last saw him. Only Sky clocks the emerald amulet roped around his neck and tucked under his cloak. He also vamps a bit. He casts the same spell he did 6 months ago at the Thistleton harvest festival (plant growth).

Sky and Aoife clock rapid horse hoofbeats approaching the festival.

We all hear a scream from the sheriff as horses crash into the crowd, skull crunch. A dagger emerges from the sheriff and a hooded figure emerges behind him.

We all roll initiative.
