### Edited Long-Form Notes 
Absent: Maysa|Zephyr

Scarlet and Genia think the river is heading towards the druid camp. Teras and Genia interrogate the wizard while they float. He says he was investigating some mystical artefacts, and found a hidden staircase into the basement. The wizard asks if we knew why the basement collapsed, and we said an undead guy seemed to bring it down. He asked if the guy had a name, and Teras says Kerek. The wizard's eyes light up and he said Kerek is supposedly one of the seven, and asks if he had a powerful artefact on him. Talbot says yes, but unfortunately the gloves were lost in the rubble. The wizard seems to buy it.

Donald, the wizard, works for Arch Magi Shaka Guzahaar at the Zhardosian Academy of Mages (we are all aware of this academy, just South of the Empire on the eastern side of Rentlam forest). He says Shaka sent him out here to collect the artefacts for research. We tell him we'll take the totem back to the druids, and he gives us a sending stone (given to Scarlet) so he can tell us if he learns any more information about The Seven.

We get to the end of the stream, Donald says goodbye and flies away. Rustling in the brush to the West, Marge emerges. She's sad we couldn't save the children, but thanks us for our efforts anyways. Teras warns her that the house is definitely an evil place. She asks us to tell her what happened. Genia does, leaving out the details of the gauntlets. She also mentions we found the wizard, and we return his totem. Genia asks if she knows a Kerek, and she says she doesn't. 

We take the kids to Vanyo, the Steward of Souls, who will prepare the kids for burial. 

Marge and Mr. Berr are meeting at dusk tomorrow for more negotiations. We've earned beds at the grove and free transport to any forest on the continent for returning the kids. If we help her out with Mr. Berr, she'll give us some kuku wood.

Talbot finally introduces himself to Marge, saying he was sent by the leadership of Cape Lamar to be present in the negotiations between the druids and Mr. Berr. He stepped through a teleportation circle that was supposed to take him to the sight of the negotiations, but ended up underground with us. 

Info for only Talbot: Talbot has heard from Yenna that Mr. Berr has a reputation for ruthlessness and lawlessness, and that he's the royal wood supplier for Wheaton. Han von Hinden is the independent merchant who sits on the noble pantheon who runs a lot of the contracts, Talbot is concerned about his escalation of power and suspect he has been approving Mr. Berr's acts of brutality.

He tells Marge that Mr. Berr's reputation precedes him, and that he is there to keep things civil, and possibly learn some information about Mr. Berr's doings.

Marge speaks to Vanyo in elvish: We weren't able to save their lives, but we've recovered the bodies of Greeson and Tina. She invites Teras and Sky inside to set the bodies down. A door off to the right creaks open, and a small half-elven child's head peeks around the corner. Vanyo apologizes and says it's just her son, and he shouldn't see this.

Genia and Teras go on a walk to discuss Talbot. Teras doesn't know what to do with his truth coin, should he use it on Talbot, Mr. Berr, someone else? Genia says she feels like he'll know when the time is right. Both of us are suspicious of Talbot. Teras asks Genia to write some questions to "her lady" for him: any info on Talbot, and info on the dream figure that gave him the coin. Genia adds an addendum: we found the gauntlets.

When we return, we see two figures at the door of the other cabin - Vanyo and Wally, dropping off some food for us. Wally stares at Genia, and chants "Thata!" (demon, in Elvish). Talbot asks why he was calling her that, and she says she has no idea.

Viri goes to see Vanyo. She asks how her son is, and she says he's just distraught over the loss of his friends. Viri seems to think she's telling the truth. 

Letter from Genia's patron
> I do not know much, but I know that Talbot Envers is not what he seems. However, he may still prove useful. You can trust him more than you can trust the King's justice for the likes of Mr. Berr. The deaths of those children disgusts me and he bears the ultimate responsibility. He cannot be allowed to get away with his crimes. He cannot be allowed to hurt more children. P.S. Sometimes dreams are a way of telling yourself the things you do not want to hear. Sometimes they are a way for powerful beings beyond our imagination to communicate with us.

Sky's dream
> In the desert, peer to the south you see a mountain rising in to the sky...not a mountain, but it's getting closer. Moonlight glinting off a statue to the SE, catching their eye. A silver statue of Repara, between them and the "mountain." The statue is sinking into the sand beneath, it comes to life and begins writhing in pain. Repara turns to look and calls out "Help me Sky, help me!" Sky runs faster than seems possible to help Repara out, reaching the edge of a whirlpool of sand. The mountain - a swirling mass of sand on the horizon, purple crackles of energy shooting out from it. Two large yellow eyes staring intently at Sky. Sky asks Repara what the sand monster is, she says she doesn't know but they need to help her. Sky reaches out, and Repara calls out again but this time the voice is lower pitched "Help me sky!" It feels cold and distant, but not unfamiliar. The statue reaches out her hand, and Sky asks who the name of the old cleric that trained them was. The rough voice says "I do not have time for your questions, help me Sky!" Sky insists they're not Repara and asks who they are. They withdraw their hand, and the statue morphs into a tall, elven man in royal clothing, green robes, a pendant around th eneck, piercing bright golden-orange eyes. He reaches out his right hand and grabs Sky by the throat, lifting them up to turn them around to face the oncoming storm. This time, the voice has palpable hatred, "You pathetic crature, I have suffered far too greatly for far too long to indulge your childish misgivings. You think you understand,, you thinkg yourself fit ot judge me. Perhaps a taste of my suffering will enlighten you. I will return Sky, and you will let me in.''"
> He holds Sky aloft as the storm descends, feeling sand and pure energy eating into their flesh and ripping them limb from limb. They feel a coldness, a feeling of pure evil, flooding through their body and chewing into their soul. As it consumes the last of their essence, they wake up gasping for air and covered in sweat. They have one level of exhaustion.

We have some frustrating conversation with Talbot to figure out if he's cool with us killing Mr. Berr. Talbot might be a robot. Teras pokes his hand to check that he's real.

We go talk to Marge. She doesn't want a new contract, but she will uphold the old arrangement. Mr. Lena is Mr. Berr's right hand man. Talbot excuses Marge, and suggests we reach out to Mr. Lena to get the poison and use it against Mr. Berr.

We go into town to find Mr. Berr. Talbot will be going into the lumber mill to speak with Mr. Lena, Viri will wait outside for him.
