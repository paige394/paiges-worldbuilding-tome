### Bulleted Notes
Retcon of the conversation with Zephyr:
- the wanted poster is Zephyr's twin; a twin she did not know she had until recently
- Zephyr wants to stay missing, at least for now; she is pretty upset with her parents
- the town guard approached the druids to inquire about the murder situation and Zephyr saw the poster, which prompted her parents to finally confess 
- Zephyr doesn't know anything about why the other kids are missing 
- the "haunted shack" was just a fun play place when Zephyr was a kid, but seems like more of a bedtime story than a legit concern 

Main Session:
- After introductions, the Earl invites us all in and offers up a joint. Aoife gets addicted to weed.
- The Earl's real name is Jameson Barnaby, and he proudly shows off his invention: the electric lute.
- Viri tries it out, and does so well that The Earl insist she needs one of her own.
- Two problems: (1) the wire must be made of pure silver, thankfully he can get some from Don DeMarco; (2) the box needs to be made of kuku wood, which grows in the forests nearby but is heavily protected by the druids, except for around the haunted shack.
- The Earl tells us about his upcoming concert in Cape Lamar, and laments that the usual crowd around there sucks. He invites us to be his entourage to spice it up a little.
- We all head to The Old Crow and meet Don DeMarco, courtesy of The Earl's introduction.
- Of note entering the VIP section, the group sees two town guards (Casper and Juice) and a large lilac-skinned half-orc (Mr. Berr). Everyone else appears to be wealthy merchants.
- Viri opens for The Earl and thoroughly impresses Don DeMarco, who happily gifts her a length of silver wire for her electric lute and allows her to play live for the non-VIP area.
- Viri asks The Earl to bestow her rock name on her.
- The guards are led into an out-of-the-way hallway by a waitress, and Genia tries to follow. She makes it into the area but doesn't get any decent information.
- Genia goes back to Teras and tells him what she was doing, which Scarlet also overhears. Scarlet and Genia eavesdrop on the guards (now out of the room) and Teras has a very awkward conversation with the prostitute in the room they came out of.
- The guards are chatting about how "it" all went wrong, and mention a merchant named Monty as the culpable party for "her" (Zata) getting loose.
- Viri is a big hit with the non-VIP crowd too.
- Don DeMarco tells us if we're heading to Cape Lamar he has a delivery job he needs done. The group isn't so sure about it, so we say we'll get back to him. 

Murder Timeline:
Day -1: Monty was supposed to show up and never did.
Day 0: The wanted posters are made.
Day 1: The Lawkeeper is killed.
Day 2: A town guard is killed.
Day 3: One of Don's people is killed.
Day 4: We arrive in town.

Present: Viri|Nate, Scarlet|Haley, Teras|Paige, Genia|Abby, Sky|Alex, Aoife|Sophie, Zephyr|Maysa

Retcon of a conversation with Zephyr:
- The wanted poster is Zephyr's sibling, a secret twin that her parents kept hidden from her.
- Zephyr wants to stay missing, at least for the time being.
- The town guard showed up at the druids' grove asking about the murder situation and Zephyr saw the poster, which prompted her parents to finally confess.
- Zephyr doesn't know anything about why the other kids are missing.
- The "haunted shack" was just a fun play place when Zephyr was a kid, but seems like more of a bedtime story than a legit concern.

Viri tells the Earl that she doesn't know anything about the money Zippy owes him, but she's not surprised. The Earl seems disappointed, like he thought that Viri might have been the delivery girl for it.  Apparently Zippy and The Earl had been placing bets on an underground halfling sumo ring in Cape Lamar, and that's where the owed money comes from. He asks if she's been to one of his concerts, to which she says no.

Viri introduces her super cool "posse" hanging out casually at the front gate, and The Earl invites everyone in. Just inside the entrance there is a music studio off to the right, including some seating for guests and a small stand with an extremely fancy, altered lute. There is a silver string running from the lute to a small wooden cube.

The Earl offers the group a joint, which Viri, Zephyr, and Aoife take him up on. Aoife promptly gains a level of addiction to pipe weed. Everyone who partook can now cast ritual spells a little faster, and all have advantage on concentration saving throws for a bit.

The Earl formally introduces himself as Jameson Barnaby. "I play music, and I think I play it pretty well. Oh, and I invented the electric lute." None of us know what that means. The rest of the group introduces themselves very awkwardly. We are a great posse.

The Earl asks to borrow Viri's lute, then proceeds to play a little ditty while telling us how he didn't want to be "just another guy with the lute," which prompted him to invent the magical amplifier. There are [[minor-illusion\|minor-illusion]] runes carved all around the inside of the box to amplify any sound that enters tenfold. He plays another little ditty, this time on the amplified lute to demonstrate.

Viri asks to try the amplifier, and abso(lute)ly shreds with her performance rolls. The Earl asks if she has any gigs coming up, and tells her he'd be honored if she would be the next generation of electric lute player. Unfortunately, there are a few obstacles in the way to her procuring her own amplifier. First, the cord needs to be made of pure silver. Thankfully, The Earl already has an arrangement with Don DeMarco, so to procure the silver they just need to go see him at The Old Crow tonight, which he promptly invites us all along for. Second, the amplifier needs to be made of a very precious type of wood called kuku wood. There are many kuku trees that grow in the forests surrounding Wheaton, but they are heavily protected by the druids that live there. Except, thankfully, for a small section of forest near an abandoned cabin to the North. There should be just enough kuku trees there to get the wood needed for one amplifier. Teras suggests we could also ask for some wood in return for helping out with the missing children.

Viri practices a bit more before we leave, performing a song about a crush she had on a 19-year-old when she was naught but 12. Following that, The Earl gives us a private concert of the fantasy equivalent of Twisted Sister's "We're Not Gonna Take It," coincidentally Bert's favorite song of his.

Viri gets The Earl's setlist for the night and he says if she wants to play some originals he'll back her up. He also invites us to be his fresh new entourage in Cape Lamar, with Viri as his special musical guest. The usual crowd "sucks" according to him, and Viri could blow any of them out of the water.

The Royal Wizard, Douglas Merton, will be teleporting The Earl there for free, but it would be way too expensive for us. The Earl says we might be able to pay with a favor or convince the wizard to give us a discount if we go talk to him (he lives on the South side of town).

Viri begins discussing her plan to seduce the wizard. It devolves from there.

---

We get to The Old Crow half an hour before open. A large man opens the door and smiles at The Earl. He asks who we are, and The Earl says we are some friends and a new performer. The bouncer leads us into a basement club. There's a disco ball, dancing lights, and torches illuminating a renovated ballroom with a bar and some private rooms along one wall. In the back left there is a conspicuous marble door that The Earl leads Viri to, the VIP area. At first it seems the rest of us will be left in the regular section, but Scarlet seems uncomfortable leaving Viri alone in the VIP area with The Earl, so he invites us all along.

The VIP bouncer tells The Earl that Don has been waiting for him and lets us all in. There is a large back room with a small stage, which is currently empty except for Don DeMarco, a gnomish man in a full tuxedo.

"Well if it isn't The Earl!" They greet each other and The Earl introduces us, with special attention on Viri, "Who would be a prodigy, but she's already better than that!" We are just Viri's crew. Don greets us warmly, but only shakes Viri's hand. He also apologizes for the heightened security and says we shouldn't hesitate to ask us for anything while we're guests in his "den of debauchery." He also tells us the first round for our crew is on him.

Scarlet gets a drink at the bar but stays in the VIP area, Aoife secures front row couches in the VIP room for the whole crew to sit on during the show. Teras excuses himself to the regular area of the club for now, and Genia joins.

Teras and Genia people watch, keeping a special eye out for guards and people entering the VIP section. Teras apologizes for keeping Genia out of the "fancy room," but says Don reminds him a lot of Baxter. We see two off-duty guards that enter the VIP area, as well as a large lilac-skinned half-orc. Everyone else that goes in just look like wealthy merchants.

In the VIP area, Aoife catches the name "Casper" for one of the guards that entered. Viri catches the name of the half-orc, "Mr. Berr." Zephyr catches the name of the other guard, "Juice," and recognizes him as a guard that she has seen around town before. Zephyr also notices that when the waitress came to take the guards' orders, she gave them little slips of paper that they wrote something on and handed back.

Along with drinks, the waitresses pass out joints to the VIP lounge. Aoife takes three, but thankfully does not get any more addicted.

DeMarco introduces The Earl and a "special up-and-coming talent to share with you," Viri. "Do remember, any services, substances, or supplies you may need, Don DeMarco has you covered!"

Viri opens on the electric lute, debuting her technique of bending strings, to rousing success. The Earl is thoroughly impressed. His set is not as titillating, but it's still a great performance for the VIP crowd. DeMarco vamps some more before coming to speak privately with Viri and The Earl.

"Damn Earl, I think you might've met your match!" Viri tries to brush it off as beginners' luck, but DeMarco tells her not to be so humble and says they need to get her her own amp as soon as possible. He has a shipment of silver that will be in tomorrow morning that he is happy to gift a string from. He then departs to chat with Mr. Berr. 

Everyone congratulates Viri. She asks The Earl why they call him that, and he just says he needed a good rocker name and it toes the line between sounding fancy and not pissing anyone off since there's no Earls in the kingdom. She asks if he'll do her the honor of giving her her rock name since he's setting her up with the electric amp and starting her new phase in music.

The guards are led to a hallway that passes behind the rest of the rooms, and Genia tries to follow. They head down a hallway, mostly full of waiters, and step up to a host stand and whisper a few things to the person standing behind it. The hostess leads them down a hallway out of Genia's view, but it looks like they went into the third door down on the right. She tries to follow them further, and the hostess tries to stop her asking what she's doing here. Genia says she's with The Earl, and the host asks who she's interested in. Genia lies and says she was just following her companions, which the hostess seems to buy. She can hear hushed voices behind the door, but can't make out what they are saying. She tries to crack the door but it squeaks as it opens, she releases the door and tries to stand as quietly as possible in hopes they ignore it. They shut the door harder, and she can't hear any better than she could before. Finally she tries to slip into the room next to them. Before she opens it, she can hear grunting and groaning coming from the room and decides to pass it by. She moves to the other adjoining room and hears nothing, so she slips in.

Back in the VIP lounge, Teras sees Genia leave and decides to give her 15 minutes before trying to follow her.

Viri wants to go party, and asks The Earl if he wants to go out into the main area and join the rabble. He politely declines. He tells her to drop the kuku wood off whenever she gathers it, and he hopes to see her in Cape Lamar. 

Viri lights up her joint and invites Scarlet out to the regular section. She asks who's playing next door, and The Earl reveals that it's a "recording" in the amp box - another little project he's been working on. She asks The Earl if she can borrow his lute to play next door, and if Don would be ok with it. The Earl gets his attention an he says "anything that gets the kids buying more drinks" is good with him.

Scarlet, Aoife, Zephyr, and Viri head out to the non-VIP area. Sky and Teras stay in the VIP lounge, at least for 15 minutes.

---

A voice calls out from the room, "A little bit shy, are we?" Genia leaves immediately and tries to hang out inconspicuously in the hallway. A server walks past her and asks if she's alright. Genia says she's just waiting for a friend, and the waitress walks past and whispers to the hostess, who heads to Genia. The hostess asks her not to wait in this hallway as they like to exercise discretion for their customers. The doors in this hallway are the same as the doors in the outer hallway, so she suggests waiting outside the third door in the common area. Genia heads back to the VIP section.

DeMarco and Mr. Berr are still conversing, as are many of the merchants.

Genia joins Sky and Teras, who asks what she was doing. She explains, and also adds that her "friend" wants her to bring the guards to justice which is why she was investigating. Sky, Teras, and Genia head back to the main area. 

Viri buys herself a whole bottle of wine and claims an empty table as her stage. The crowd slowly warms to her and she eventually makes 3gp in tips. Aoife catches the guards leaving the third room about 25 minutes into Viri's performance and head to the bar. She yells out to the group, and Genia tells Teras she wants to know who's in there.

Teras goes to the room. Sitting on the red couch in a sparkly white dress is an elven woman. She says it's 5gp for her services. Teras says he needs to know her name before he can decide. She introduces herself as "Bea," and a very awkward conversation ensues where Teras tries to get some information out of her without revealing too much about himself. It doesn't go very well, so Teras quickly excuses himself.

Scarlet, who has been half listening, comes over to finally sus out what's happening. She asks why we don't just listen in, or talk to them, so we do just that.

Genia overhears them talking to the merchant, including their names (Casper, Juice, and a female half-elf named Zanzy). They mention the death of the previous lawkeeper, and the two guards seem to be asking the merchant how things went so wrong. How did "she," Zata, get loose. Zanzy mentions another merchant by the name of Monty as the culpable party, and does not have an explanation for what happened. They didn't have any issues prior, but whatever went wrong they took it to their grave.

Monty was expected to arrive in Wheaton from Thistleton two days before the lawkeeper was assassinated, but they did not show up and they have news that they are dead, mentioning "slaughter" or "massacre."

In Viri's final performance, she asks for a woman's name in the crowd and plops it into one of her songs. The Don catches her final performance and congratulates her, saying she's welcome any time.

Viri returns the electric lute, and Genia and Scarlet go to thank The Don and ask about his guards. He says they lost Big Johnny, one of his best men, with a poison bolt to the heart. If he knew anything about who was doing it, they wouldn't be doing it any more.

Genia buys a disguise kit. Don also asks if we'll be in Cape Lamar, and says that he needs some business taken care of if we're interested, a package delivery to the dock ward in Cape Lamar.

### Raw Notes 
Retcon of a conversation with Zephyr:

- the wanted poster is Zephyr's sibling 
- Zephyr wants to stay missing 
- the twin is a secret twin! Zephyr is on the lookout for them 
- the police showed up at the druids' asking about the murder situation and Zephyr saw the poster, which prompted her parents to finally confess 
- Zephyr doesn't know anything about why the other kids are missing 
- The "haunted shack" was just a fun play place when Zephyr was a kid, but seems like more of a bedtime story than a legit concern

Viri says she doesn't know anything about the money but she's not surprised. The Earl seems disappointed, like he thought Viri might be a money delivery. He asks if she's been to one of his concerts and that's how she knows his sound. She also introduces her "posse," us standing awkwardly at the end of the drive. 

Apparently they bet on an underground halfling sumo ring in Cape Lamar, and this is where the owed money comes from. He invites us all in. It's a "typical house." There is a music studio off to the right, including some seating for guests and a small stand with an extremely fancy, altered lute. There is a silver string running from the lute to small wooden cube. The Earl offers us all a joint. 

Viri, Zephyr, and Aoife take him up on it. Aoife gets one level of addiction to pipe weed. Everyone who partook can now cast ritual spells a little faster, and has advantage on concentration saving throws. 

The Earl introduces himself as Jameson Barnaby. "I play music, and I think I play it pretty well. Oh and I invented the electric lute." Everyone else introduces themselves one by one, VERY awkwardly.

The Earl asks to borrow Viri's lute. He plays a little ditty (13), and then tells us how he didn't want to be "just another guy with a lute" and so he invented the magical amplifier. There are runes carved all along the inside of the box, of [[minor-illusion\|minor-illusion]] to amplify the sound tenfold. He shreds another ditty (12). Both were just ok performance rolls.

Viri asks to try it out, and abso(lute)ly shreds with a 24 performance. He asks if she has any gigs, and says he'd be honored for her to be the next electric lute player. There's just two problems: (1) the cord has to be pure silver, they just need to stop by to see Don DeMarco for it; he's going to play a show at The Old Crow tonight and invites us along. (2) for the runes to work, you need a specific type of wood: kuku wood, which fortunately grows in the woods around Wheaton, but is unfortunately heavily protected by the druids. There's a section of forest in the North by an old abandoned cabin that the druids no longer protect, and there's some kuku trees growing in that area. Teras suggests we could ask for some kuku wood in return for finding the missing druid kids too. The trees are bamboo-like, we should only need a 5-6 ft. section for one amp. 

Viri practices for a bit before we leave for The Old Crow. She performs a song about a crush she had on a 19yo when she was 12????? Appropriately, 19 performance check.

The Earl gives us a private concert afterwards. A version of "We're Not Gonna Take It." Coincidentally, this is Bert's favorite song of The Earl's.

Viri gets his setlist and The Earl says if she wants to play some originals he'll back her up. He also invites us to be his fresh new entourage at Cape Lamar, with Viri as his special musical guest. The usual crowd "sucks" according to him, and Viri could blow any of them out of the water.
