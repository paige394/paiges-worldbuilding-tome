### Edited Long-Form Notes 

### Raw Notes
Today is April 5th, the day of the Royal Ball. Doors open at 5pm, people begin to gather around 3:30. Dinner, dancing, drinks.

Talbot speaks with Skye to brush up on his knowledge about Whispering Ridge - which turns out to be not much.

Teras and Genia head to sell the sapphires from Luck's and then go to the chef at La Brillo Stado for another job. We sell the Sapphires for 235gp,  but La Brillo Stado is closed for the ball.

Skye sees Bam Ernst, the sheriff from Bartholomew. They greet him, but he doesn't seem to remember them at first. He does remember that Viri stole his badge though.

Dianna quizzes Scarlet on the layout of the Count's house, but is thoroughly disappointed.

Genia sees a human cactus talking to the Count. Most people at the ball don't seem perturbed by it. 

Talbot speaks to a bureacrat and a woman involved in the mining business in Traxeldorf. Cirilla and  Luris deSalis. He gets the sense that they were discussing ways to get around some of the new business restrictions, but are unwilling to continue it with Talbot in the circle. Talbot remembers that Luris is a government official involved in the management and oversight of mining industries.

Scarlet recalls that our tickets were reduced so the Count could make room for the Herbone Vizier - the cactus person speaking to him now.

Teras and Skye notice disguised Talbot.

Teras gets tapped on the shoulder, and turns to see a tall well-dressed Elvish man who says 'You've finally come to fulfill your promise, Teras.' I recognize him as Jorge Matos, the private combat trainer who worked for Baxter for many years. He thinks Teras wants to kill him.

Teras asks for a conversation. He asks if he knew what Baxter was doing. Jorge says not specifically, but names Thandor (the Mayor), Janeus, Plintus, DaVick (Lightkeepers). Teras asks if the pay was good enough for him to turn a blind eye, and Jorge says that he did the opposite. He trained the fighters to survive. Jorge is the personal trainer for the Trevail family. He tells me I can find him at the Sleeping Giant Tavern in the Dock Ward.

Skye sees Donald Argyle, the mage who was trapped in the basement of the house in Wheaton. He's speaking to an important-looking gnomish wizard. Donald greets them warmly and introduces them to Archmagi Guzahar, Dean of Divination at the Xhardosian academy. He also introduces Karn Trevail.

They ask Skye about the artifact and how they came across Donald, and tells him how they were there to save some druid children. He asks them if Skye and their companions could come to the Academy at the Cape and give us our recollection of the events surrounding Donald's freezing. Skye replies they will have to check the schedule. They ask Skye what brings them here, and they explain we are Viri's entourage.

Teras asks Talbot if he knows Jorge Matos, and Talbot does know him as the Trevail's personal trainer. Teras tells him he used to be a slaver and that Talbot should look into that. He asks Teras if this is an altruistic move or if he has ulterior motives, but Teras no longer responds.

Everyone but Teras settles in for dinner. Kylian is sitting next to the Count. Talbot tries to get a seat within earshot of Kylian, and is successful.

The Count makes an announcement to begin the feast, including a few special guests: the winner of the nobles' joust, Kylian vonHimm; a commoner who shows great dedication to the city, Timothy Berr; the chef of the evening, Reginald vonHoff. He hands it off to The Earl to perform a tribute to Vincent Hayes before dinner commences. 

Viri notices that "Timothy Berr's" has a reddish glow to it before quickly fading back to blue. 

Genia goes outside to retrieve Teras, who follows reluctantly.

Yenna messages Talbot, "The Count is mocking me."

Talbot is joined by Dane Lamarelli, a halfling male ambassador from the Elucian empire, and Torrone Norwood, a tiefling female from Zarmazenta. Something is impacting the efficiency of Zarmazenta's mining operations. 

Genia and Teras are joined by Fink Precipe, human female and Mayor of Tunaville.

Scarlet is sitting with Dianna, who excuses herself to go to the restroom. She asks Scarlet to fetch her a human attendant to see to the bathroom. Scarlet does so, and Dianna opens the door and walks through. Scarlet tries to follow, but Dianna insists the attendant will not hurt her. She relents when Scarlet presses the issue. Dianna points to something on the floor for the attendant see, and then pulls out something that flashes in the light from a candle and stabs the attendant in the chest. 

Dianna begins to search the man's body, then pulls out a card that allows the attendants to gain access to different rooms in the house. She insists the Count is in possession of a very dangerous object that she mut retrieve. She calls him a scoundrel and says that he got to where he is by cheating, lying, and being  ruthless. Scarlet asks what will happen to the item, and Dianna says it's going to someone she trusts.

On the way out, Scarlet asks her about the Count's long-lost cousin. She says that she does not know anything. They sneak out into a lounge area. Dianna reveals she is searching for half of the sword.
