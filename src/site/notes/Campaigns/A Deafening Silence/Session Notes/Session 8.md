### Edited Long-Form Notes 
Present: Viri|Nate, Scarlet|Haley, Teras|Paige, Genia|Abby, Sky|Alex, Aoife|Sophie  

The guards tell us that security is heightened because of the murder of the Justice, and as such they need all our names and length of stay. Viri, Teras, Scarlet Nobleheart, Sky, Just Aoife, Genia, and Bert Casper are passing through to deliver goods to the Golden Goose Inn and Tongueston's Depot (general store). They seem to accept that none of us have last names and put us down as staying at the Golden Goose Inn for a week.

Most of the traffic on the street seems to be guards, and any citizens we do see about are rather timid. Bert bids us farewell and asks if there's something he can call us, to which Teras replies we don't have a group name because we aren't really a group. 

Before Bert can leave, Teras asks about the good word he was owed. Bert says he just needs to unload his cargo, and then they can go find "the man in charge." Teras offers to help him unload the cart to speed up the process, and Genia tags along. 

Everyone else heads to the tailor. Viri wants "anything in black," while Scarlet asks what would be best to meet The Earl. The shopkeep responds she doesn't keep up with the trends, so Scarlet tries for a simple dress.

At the Golden Goose Inn, Viri asks the proprietor about The Earl. The innkeep (a middle-aged male dwarf) replies that there's no Earl in town, just the Lawkeeper and the Royal Wizard. Viri asks instead where the riff-raff hang out, and he says some come here but most go to The Old Crow. It looks like an old house, but there's a secret underground establishment. New customers have to pay an entry fee.

Viri, Scarlet, Aoife, and Sky all get separate rooms. Genia and Teras share a room.

---

Bert takes Teras and Genia to see Sebastian, the new Lawmaster. Nobody else tags along, partially because Teras didn't mention it to anyone. The guard at the door asks what our business is, and Bert steps up and says he's here to speak to an old friend. 

Lawkeeper Sebastian Tarnoc, a human male in his 60s, sits behind the desk waiting for us to come in. Bert and the Lawkeeper exchange pleasantries. He asks who "these funny fellas are," and Bert introduces us as the "most skilled cutswords he's ever hired." He apparently trusts Teras and Genia "much farther than he can throw us."

Sebastian asks what we came to speak to him for, and Teras nervously declares that he would like to report some improper behavior from Lightkeepers. The Lawmaster laughs and says we came to the wrong place, he is not exactly friendly with them any more. He was "forcibly retired" from the organization, and jokes that Bert got out at the right time. 

Teras says since Sebastian is being honest he'll return the favor, and that he has a score to settle with a few Lightkeepers. He asks if Sebastian knows anything about a raid by a nomadic tribe on Thistleton about 9 years ago. Sebastian says he doesn't know specifics, but that he knows there is a lot of corruption within the Lightkeepers, and working security in their off time is one method of that. He suggests either the Lightkeepers were already there by coincidence, or there was an inside man. 

Teras dismisses that thought and asks how he would go about finding who was there that night. Sebastian asks if Bert gave us any names, and Teras says he did but he would like to see if they give the same names.

Sebastian names Janeus, a sergeant above him that he hated and who "seemed real committed to the cause." Teras says he won't be real helpful any more, but if it gets him in Sebastian's good graces he's the one who broke his nose. 

Genia asks if he knows of the fighting rings and any connection to the Lightkeepers. He says he knew of it, but didn't know any by name. He's definitely holding something back. Teras says he appreciates the help so far, but he is willing to do almost anything to get the information Sebastian isn't giving them. Genia tries to intimidate him by revealing her sword.

Sebastian asks Bert to step out of the room. He reveals that he's in a real shitstorm in Wheaton as the prior Lawkeeper and half the guards in town were crooked, which leaves behind a lot of mess for him to clean up. If we can take something off his plate, he'll share some deeper information with us. 

Wheaton hangs in a precarious balance between the townspeople and the druids in the forest to the North and South. The druids are unhappy with the town carving right through the middle of the forest. There has been some tension, but the peace has mostly been kept. Recently, the druids have been up in arms as some of their kids have started to go missing. One went missing about a week ago, a halfling named Zephyr (late teens/maybe 20, living at home) with no explanation. The previous two nights, a child has gone missing from the North forest. Tina, a half-elf teenager and Greeson, a gnome late teens. There's an old abandoned cottage to the North of town where some weird lights and sounds are coming that might have something to do with it.

Teras says that if he settles the issue with the druids, he would like complete and open honesty from Sebastian, whether that gives him the answers he wanted or not. He also says he has something to facilitate that from the both of them. Sebastian replies that honesty, even 150 miles away from the Empire, is dangerous, but he can give us his honest opinion if we can solve this problem for him.

---

Viri and Scarlet go searching for The Old Crow. They find a building matching the rough description from the Golden Goose's proprietor, but the doorman says they don't open until nine and to come back later.

---

Teras and Genia go shopping. Genia buys some studded leather armor and looks for a disguise kit. Teras buys some new clothes.

---

Sky searches for other temples: Ennegara, goddess of health(?), Repara, and Blazein all have one on the main street. They are not able to find any other temples in their brief search.

Sky goes to visit the temple of Ennegara, which functions more like a hospital than a temple. They don't really do collective worship/services but tend to the wounded and sick. Sky looks for a statue of the goddess, and gets awkwardly solicited for a donation, which they give 5gp for. They say they took a wrong turn and didn't mean to disturb the priests' work, so they'll be on their way.

In Wheaton, the symbol of Repara is, big shocker, a piece of wheat. Sky goes to the temple of Repara and joins in on a prayer taking place. After, they greets the priests. The priests tell Sky that the temple is involved with the farmers and harvest, but also in keeping good relationships with the druids, which they say has been tense recently. The logging company wants to clear more land but the druids insist they're doing ecological damage, and with "recent events" the town is a bit of a boiling kettle. Along with the previous Lawkeeper, a few guards have been killed as well. Sky says things have been stirring in Whispering Ridge as well, where they are from. They thank the priest and pray.

As they pray, they hear a whispering voice in Celestial. They focus on it to hear what is being said. "Let me in."

---

We all meet back up at the inn. As we each walked around town, we saw wanted posters for the murderer of the prior Lawkeeper, who looks very similar to Zephyr except for a long scar across their eye.

Teras asks if he can hire everyone for their help with the druids' children because the Lawkeeper has agreed to give him some information on the group that killed his mom. Scarlet and Viri say they'll do it for free. Scarlet then tries to casually ask after Sebastian, to which Teras responds he looks stressed after his "forcible retirement." Genia asks if she knows him, which Scarlet denies. Teras can tell she's lying but doesn't push it.

Viri tells them about the nightclub she's going to tonight. Genia asks if she can come along, and Teras offers to pose as their bodyguards for "street cred." Scarlet says she doesn't think they need street cred to get into a nightclub, and having a bodyguard might actually be a hindrance. Viri says Genia is welcome to come.

Aoife hears a whisper, "That cabin is haunted!" When she asks by who, "A bad person!" She asks who the voice is, "A friend." How do you know me? "I'm a friend of a friend. I know Douglas and Pina and Shrub." Aoife has no idea who any of these people are. 

Aoife asks where they are, and the voice says "Right here!" She asks if the voice can move something, and Aoife feels a brush against her ear. She asks if the voice is a tree, and the voice asks if she is stupid. Aoife asks why she can't see the voice, who says "I'm invisible." They tease Aoife for being short and asking too many questions, to which Aoife replies "Well it's because I'm an adult and I have a lot of adult questions." The voice also reveals their name is Pete, and claims the best way to get their attention is to honk like a goose. The voice disappears.

---

Scarlet goes to see Seb. The guard asks for her business, and she says she's a tourist just coming to file some complaints with the sheriff. The guard says the Lawkeeper is very busy but she can file a report with him. Scarlet gives her name and tells the guard to tell Seb she is here. She hears some shouting and loud stomping footsteps. Seb rushes out and tackles Scarlet with a hug. 

"Scarlet ya bastard, where have you been!" He invites her in to catch up.

He asks what she's been up to, and she tells him the full story, including the part about Janeus (the first and second times) and the misadventures with her new companions. Seb says "those dumb fucks" should have said they knew Scarlet, but she tells him she didn't tell them about him to help keep his cover. Seb says he's pretty sure Genia/Teras' story about being wronged by Lightkeepers and wanting vengeance is true, "but you can never be too careful."

Scarlet asks what the hell happened, and Sebastian gives the short version of "I got marked to replace the Lawbringer." She also asks if we told him about the druid/halfling girl, and reveals that the missing kid is probably traveling with them. She was kidnapped by cultists and the group rescued her, but she has been in hiding ever since.

Seb says that if Zephyr is the one that killed him, he deserved it. He also reveals that Mr. Moresec drew up the wanted posters of not-Zephyr the day before he died, but he hadn't specified what she was wanted for yet. There are also letters to and from Thistleton and Cape Lamar to the prior Lawkeeper. The letters are in common, but are coded somehow and he can't break it for the life of him.

"I didn't tell your friends this, but the Lawkeeper isn't the only one whose been killed recently. A guard had his throat slit on patrol near the Southern border two nights ago. Then last night, a thug working for Don DeMarco (proprietor of The Old Crow, a popular haunt for the guards despite the illegal activities) was killed on the way home.  The judge could be on your friend, but those two...probably not on her. Someone is enacting a campaign of vengeance." He asks Scarlet to keep that information to herself for the moment. 

Scarlet says she doesn't want to put Seb out, but since she does know the minotaur it would mean a lot if he could give a little bit of extra information. She says they will still look into the other missing kids, even if he does give more info now. 

Sebastian launches into a story. He was promoted to first commander of the border division, reporting to Vic Sartosa, Commander of the Light on the border. He was given easy missions since he's getting up there in age, until one day he was served up what should have been an easy mission: guarding an exploratory party from the Zhardosian academy of mages heading into Rentlam forest. It seemed a little odd to him, but thought if the commander was giving it to him it must be ok. Roughly a day into the forest, the journey starts getting real dark. The sun hasn't shone this deep for decades, but their group sees a spot of light up ahead. They get there and Sebastian discovers they're not the first exploratory mission, they've been on a journey to an active dig site this whole time. 

"Now I'm wondering what the hell's going on since they have a site up here already, and all of the sudden a bunch of albino elves and spider people pop out of nowhere and slaughter the wizards at the site. I'm ashamed to admit it, but I lost every single person under my command and barely made it out alive myself. I decided then and there that I was done, left my armor and everything that tied me to the Lightkeepers there in the forest and headed south for Wheaton. Figured I could have a nice calm retirement, which turns out not to be the case. The moral of the story is, if you're asking about corruption in the Lightkeepers, it goes all the way to the top." 

He also reveals that before he left, Vic Sartosa, the golden child, born into a noble family and handpicked to ascend, was on the path to become The Eternal Flame (leader of the Lightkeepers) within a few days.

Scarlet asks if it was an ambush. "I think I was leading a mission I wasn't supposed to be leading, and he lied to me to get me there. Clearly he and these mages are looking for something important and powerful in Rentlam forest and I got my whole team killed for the trouble."

Scarlet says she thinks she knows what they were looking for: an artefact of The Seven. Seb says that sounds like the kind of thing that would be right up their alley. The dig site was only a few hundred feet across, so it seemed they had narrowed in on a location. The Lightkeepers could have it, or the spider people might.

Scarlet asks specifically about the fighting rings, to which he says he doesn't have any specific information. Vic might have some shares in them if he's that corrupt. She also asks about The Earl, who he says he's heard of and thinks lives in the Southwestern part of town.

She thanks him for the info and says if he needs anything from her, she's with a pretty capable group. He says if she stops by later today, he can have someone scrounge up some better weapons from the armory for her friends.

---

Scarlet gathers us all in her room at the inn and tries to soundproof it as best she can. She says she hasn't been fully truthful about her relationship with Seb, and reveals their history and that she was worried to reveal anything about him to people she just met.

She tells us everything Seb told her. We all agree to head to Rentlam forest after this business with the druids. 

Before dinner, we all set out to try and find The Earl. Appropriately, Viri is the one who catches a strange melody coming from a fenced-in house in the Southwest of town. 

Viri approaches the door alone, tuning up her lute and playing a lick to make sure everything is in good shape. She knocks loudly. 

"Who's there?" "A fan." "Fuck the fans." "I lied, I'm not a fan. I want to learn from you." "I'm not a fucking teacher!" "Fuck you!" Viri plays a sick riff (26 performance). "Could use some work but...you might have some stuff." "I know that, that's why I'm here to see you motherfucker. Oh, and Zippy sent me." The door finally opens. A half-elf in a red bath robe to his knees, slippers, and long silvery hair falling down mid-back. "That motherfucker owes me money!"

Fin.

### Raw Notes

"Lawkeeper Tarnoc will see you."

Human male in his 60s sitting behind the desk, waiting for us to come in. Bert and the Lawkeeper exchange pleasantries. He asks who "these funny fellas are," and Bert introduces us as the "most skilled cutswords I've ever hired." He apparently trusts both of us "farther than he can throw us."

Scarlet gathers us all up back at the inn. She gathers us all in her room and tries to soundproof it as best she can. She says she hasn't been fully truthful about her relationship with Seb, and reveals their history and that she was worried to reveal anything about him to people she just met.

She tells us everything Seb told her. We all agree to head to Rentlam forest, for various reasons or another.

Before dinner we all set out to try and find The Earl. Appropriately, Viri is the one who catches a strange melody coming from a fenced-in house in the Southwest of town. She remembers that Zippy sadi to tell The Earl he sent her. 

Viri approaches the door alone, tuning up her lute and playing a lick to make sure everything is in good shape. She knocks loudly. "Who's there?" "A fan." "Fuck the fans." "I lied, I'm not a fan.
