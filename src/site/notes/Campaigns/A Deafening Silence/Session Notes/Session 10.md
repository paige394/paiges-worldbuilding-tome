### Bulleted Notes
- Heading back from The Old Crow, we hear crossbow bolts firing in an alley and Viri and Zephyr sneak to investigate
- They find the bodies of Juice and Casper, the guards from the VIP lounge 
- Investigation yields the presence of an odd patch of dying grass that covers a hatch leading to a tunnel system, as well as the information that the guards were poisoned 
- Scarlet heads to go tell Sebastian about what has just happened
- Genia, Teras, and Aoife head Southwest in the tunnels and find an underground entrance to The Old Crow alongside a sealed box with a small vial of white powder and a letter from Don DeMarco to Mr. Berr 
- Viri, Sky, and Zephyr head Northeast and follow a few branches in the tunnel to a door, behind which they can hear Mr. Berr speaking to someone about "teaching those druids a lesson," as well as a package he is expecting from Don DeMarco
- The six of us meet by Mr. Berr's door, and upon hearing about the package Genia wants to head back and steal the box we found
- On the way, we run into Sebastian who tries to shoo us out of the tunnels as soon as possible 
- Viri manages to sneak into the office after hearing everyone leave and grabs a paper detailing a poison specifically for killing plant life
- Genia convinces Sebastian she dropped something and is escorted by guards back to where the box should be, only to find it gone 
- Back in the safety of the inn, Genia identifies the poison used on the guards as [[drow-poison\|drow-poison]] 
- The next morning we head to the druids, and upon entering the home of their leader Marge, she instantly recognizes Zephyr

### Edited Long-Form Notes 
Present: Viri|Nate, Teras|Paige, Genia|Abby, Sky|Alex, Aoife|Sophie, Zephyr|Maysa 

The group heads back from Don DeMarco's den of debauchery a little after midnight. Passing past a particularly tight alley, Viri, Zephyr, and Sky hear the firing of two crossbow bolts (triple NAT 20 perceptions!). Viri and Zephyr sneak up to investigate and find two dead bodies, and catch the glimpse of someone running away on the other end of the alley about 100ft away. Viri takes off running to follow them but cannot catch up. Zephyr recognizes the bodies as Juice and Casper, the guards we saw at Don DeMarco's VIP lounge.

Viri returns to get the rest of us while Zephyr begins to investigate. She notices an odd patch of yard on an adjoining house. The patch of grass is older, browner, not growing as well but she can't tell why. Genia, Teras, and Sky return with Viri and begin to investigate as well. We can see they were both shot through the heart, and there is a black liquid that Sky recognizes as a poison, but doesn't know the exact type. They also have their coinpurses still, so it does not appear they were robbed. Roughly 12gp 11sp, which is quite a lot for small town guards. 

Investigating the weird patch of grass, we can see unnaturally clean lines around the edge of the patch. Pulling back the grass a bit we find a trap door. Teras pries the door open with a crowbar. Those of us with darkvision can see a ladder down into a tunnel that branches off to the Southwest and Northeast. 

Genia, Teras, and Aoife split Southwest. Viri, Sky, and Zephyr go Northeast. Teras expresses worry about splitting up, especially since there is poison involved, so Zephyr kindly grants him [[protection-from-poison\|protection-from-poison]]. 

We don't see any signs of recent travel, but we can tell that the path we are heading on leads us back towards Don DeMarco's. We also see a small cubbyhole with a wooden box in it. Aoife investigates and doesn't find anything odd about it. Genia grabs the box. It has a wax seal with the crest of Don DeMarco (a hand tossing a few coins into the air). We are also right next to a large steel door that probably leads to The Old Crow. 

Genia opens the box, breaking the seal. Inside is a small glass jar filled with a white, powdery, whisp-y substance. There's also a small note written in code. The letter is addressed to Mr. Berr, sender is Don DeMarco. Genia tries to forge a replacement seal, but it doesn't go very well.

Viri, Sky, and Zephyr get to a fork. One heads east, one heads west. They determine there is some recent activity following the path to the right. They follow the path to the right and come to another fork, but cannot determine which had recent activity. One is a staircase with a hatch. They follow the other path and come to a new set of stairs leading up to a hatch. They hear voices through the door, one of which they recognize as Mr. Berr. They decide to wait for the others to arrive.

Teras, Aoife, and Genia catch up to them and Viri fills us in. Aoife tries to stealthily crack the door open, which she does successfully. It seems that Mr. Berr is filling in a subordinate on a plan. Despite only two voices being heard, she can hear footsteps and chairs scraping that indicate there are more than just those two. "We're gonna teach those fuckin druids a lesson. They'll think twice about denying us our wood again." Some discussion of a poison, and a package they're expecting from Don DeMarco.

Genia, Teras, and Zephyr head back to get the box. On the way, we run into Scarlet and some town guards. Sebastian tries to hustle us out of the tunnels, but Genia insists she needs to pick up something she dropped. She heads back towards the box, escorted by two guards. When she returns, the box is gone.

Viri tries to open the hatch but finds it blocked. She muscles her way through into an office, and grabs a piece of paper that details a poison that would devastate a large area of plants (Wood's Widow). She can hear someone approaching, so she grabs the paper and flees.

Zephyr notices a few of the guards giving her a second look as they pass. 

When Genia returns to the group, she asks if they should warn the druids. Teras says they should sleep and do it tomorrow. 

Viri asks one of the guards what he thinks is happening. The guard suspects the druids are tired of this town, and they're finally fighting back by picking off the guards one by one. "Problem is, the new guy in charge is a coward and won't let us do anything." Viri asks what he would do if he were in charge, and he says he'd "get answers." 

We all head back to the inn, and Genia is able to identify the poison as Drow Poison. 

--- 

The next morning, Zephyr guides us to meet the leader of the druids. As she does, we pass through town and locate spatially what is probably the place we heard Mr. Berr speaking: Wheaton Timber. 

We enter the druid grove, stumbling into a group of kids playing jacks. One of the kids tells Teras he's really big. He asks them where Marge is, and the kid points to a large tree. Teras knocks. The door opens by itself and we can see a sparse living area covered in plants with a small circle of stones, a woman with her legs crossed sitting in the center. The woman looks up with completely white eyes. 

"Hello, Zephyr."
