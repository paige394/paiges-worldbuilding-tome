### Edited Long-Form Notes 

### Raw Notes
Kylian hands Talbot his metal, and Viri insists that she needs to go see Kylian. She tries to make her way to where the nobles are gathered. 

They fail to get Kylian's attention, and Teras assures Viri they'll get him another time.

Scarlet places third in the pie-eating contest.

Finally, the nobles: Curtran Pendle dragonborn f, Fineas Vernon tiefling M, Pock Grimbeard dwarf M, Imbrus Sendor gnome F, Kylian von Himm half-elf M

Joust Outcomes:
Curtran v Fineas - Fineas is knocked off his horse 
Kylian v Pock - neither are unseated in the first or second pass, Kylian is knocked off in the third pass 
Curtran v Imbrus - neither are unseated in the first round, Curtran is knocked off in the second round 
Fineas v Pock - Fineas is knocked off his horse in the third round 
Kylian v Imbrus - Imbrus is knocked off first round 

Kylian v Curtran - tie battle at the moment 

Curtran gets upset and accuses Kylian of cheating, Kylian challenges him to a duel to defend his honor. Kylian's left shoulder is pierced by the lance, but Curtran is hit in the head. Kylian stands and pulls the lance out of his shoulder, walks to Curtran, and stabs him through the heart. Kylian has won the jousting competition, and therefore an invitation to the ball.

The rest of us relax for the afternoon, and Talbot attempts to get some information on Kylian. His shipping contacts tell him Kylian is not involved in the shipping efforts of the Count at Cape Lamar. His police contact (Wilbur) tells him Vincent Hayes' death is likely not cult-related, then searches the records for Kylian. It shows he's a distant cousin of the count and arrived a few months ago, assisting the count in his business matters. But Wilbur tells him the 'official' stories of the wealthy are often untrue. 

Talbot goes to see Yenna. She chastises him for his recent run-in with the royal watch (Skye's arrest), and says that the Count was the one who resolved the situation as he sponsored us all. She also asks after his progression of the search for the relics. He explains that Kylian's appearance has thrown a wrench into his getting to know us. Yenna says that the 'official' story is bullshit, and asks Talbot to keep an eye on him and make sure he 'doesn't fall under the sway of the count'. Talbot insists that due to all of the recent hubbub, he should come to the ball. Yenna says that Vincent had some delicate information about royals in the city, and is worried that the killer may have gained some of that information. Yenna does not want her and Talbot's relationship to be put into the public eye, and Talbot offers to disguise himself.

Yenna also tells him she has hired an associate who will be attending the ball and may be involved in illicit activities, but 'Long live Cape Lamar' will identify them as a friend.

Skye asks Talbot about the Count, and confides that they feel like they have seem him before. They head to the Count's estate. Small talk ensues, and the Count offers sympathy for what has recently happened in Whispering Ridge. He says that a week or so ago, marauders raided the town and burnt some houses. He says that a former Lightkeeper in Whispering Ridge (Plintus) requested aid, and the Count sent some along. The Count asks if Skye will be attending the ball, and they say that they will be in attendance as Viri's entourage and generally hypes Viri up to him. 

During dinner, the Count brings up the Royal Watch encounter, and asks Skye why they were attending to apprehend them. They says that when they attempted to talk to the Royal Watch, the charges had been dropped, so they're not sure why they were being questioned. The Count asks if they've done anything wrong, and Skye says it's very strange. They apologize for the disturbance and the Count says it's not a problem, but says an officer told them Skye was communing with the dead. Skye does not deny this, and asks if it's not common practice. They also tell him about the mysterious music box and it's potential ties to the cult.

The Count tells Skye why he invited them. He confides that his cousin Kylian has changed his outlook on the world recently - the world is much bigger than I previously thought it was. He asks Skye if they have ever thought there were other worlds out there, and Skye says they have not considered it. The dinner ended.
