### Bulleted Notes
- The butler tells us his name is Sebastian and asks why we are at the cottage
- Scarlet tells him we are looking for missing children, and convinces him to give us a tour to verify they aren't here 
- Sebastian tells us he was made by "Mistress Payne," who has been gone for some time conducting research, and that he's keeping the house up in her absence
- He also tells us nobody is allowed in her study, and that there is a dog named Gregor in the house 
- Viri goes to the "bathroom," but sneaks into the study and steals some books in old Elvish 
- Teras says he's afraid of dogs and stays downstairs to investigate while the tour moves upstairs - he finds a powdered spellcasting component in the couch cushions
- Upstairs, Gregor is revealed to be a huge skeletal owlbear, and in Miss Payne's room the name "Kerek" is discovered carved into the wood of the bedpost
- Sebastian refuses to show the study, but Scarlet persuades him by saying there's a broken window and that it needs to be cleaned, and Sebastian should leave the door cracked so he can call for help if he needs it
- Genia mage hands the door open a bit, and sees a room reminiscent of the zombie-harvest room in the Drow tower; she also opens the floo a bit and sees a sooty handprint on the wall 
- Sebastian is upset we tried to peek in the room, and shuts it firmly before finishing his cleaning 
- Genia crawls up the chimney from the first floor and disappears down a chute; she discovers a hallway with a locked door, a book on an altar at the end of it, and an apparently dead body in a faint circle
- Sebastian kicks us all out, and after an unsuccessful search for another entry into the "basement," we chain him up and force our way through the chimney upstairs 
- Scarlet enters the circle and gets trapped until Viri successfully [[dispel-magic\|dispel-magic]]s it 
- The man in the circle is alive, but very dehydrated; Sky casts spare the dying, Genia takes the totem from him 
- Down one hallway with a sarcophagus, Genia and Teras see a teen lying face down - when they try to enter the hallway they are attacked by shadows 
- The teen is dead, with their eyes burned out of their head; there is a bloody handprint on the sarcophagus placard, definitely larger than the teen's 
- As we struggle to open the double doors behind the altar, Viri is spirited away, face-to-face with a sphinx

### Edited Long-Form Notes 
Absent: Aoife|Sophie, Zephyr|Maysa

The weird butler asks us how he can help. Scarlet explains that we are looking after some missing children, and think they might've run in here to play. Sebastian insists there are no children here. Scarlet says it's possible they're hiding and asks if we can look around. Sebastian is willing to give us a tour to prove they aren't here.

As the tour starts, Sebastian tell us he was made by his mistress, Mistress Payne. She left to do some research, and hasn't returned in quite some time. He's been instructed to stay away from her research notes (in the study) while she's gone, and to keep the house ready for her return. He cleans every day. Genia asks who is making the house messy if Sebastian is the only one here, and he says Gregor the dog. 

As the tour continues to the living room, Viri says she needs to piss and is directed back through the study. Viri steals the books from the study (A Natural History of Arkividros, Vol. 2 by Marielle the Younger; Forsheka's Index of Deities and Other Significant Beings by Forsheka), and tries to read the page one was open to. It's in a very old, high elf dialect that Viri can only sort of make out. It's about some type of flower that Viri can't translate.

Sebastian continues the tour upstairs, Teras pleads a fear of dogs to stay downstairs. Scarlet, Genia, and Sky go upstairs. 

Sebastian shows them his bedroom (left door upstairs), which is also where Gregor is sleeping. Gregor is an ~8ft long skeletal owlbear. Apparently Gregor loves company. Middle door upstairs is Miss Payne's room. Normal looking bed (with an ensuite!), wooden bedframe, but investigation check reveals a name carved into the wood: Kerek. Scarlet asks Sebastian about it, and he says he's never heard that name, but agrees it's odd that the name is carved into the post.

Sebastian refuses to show them the next room, as it's Miss Payne's laboratory and she forbid anyone from entering. The room has been locked since she left, so there's no way the kids got in there. Scarlet surmises that the window that we saw into earlier was the laboratory window. She tells Sebastian that it's broken, and that they should probably check inside the room to make sure everything is safe. He says he will need to verify that first.

Teras snoops downstairs while Sebastian is upstairs. Tucked in between some of the couch cushions is a line of fine black powder, arcana check reveals it's a spellcasting component for an enchantment-style spell. Seems like it's probably less than a year old. 

Sebastian leads everyone outside, and seems surprised that the window is broken. He says that he will enter the room to check for children and fix the window, but he can't let anyone else enter. Scarlet asks if he can at least leave the door open so he can call for help if anything goes awry. With a NAT 20 persuasion from Scarlet, he agrees.

Scarlet and Sky catch a glimpse of a black slab in the middle of the room and some charts they can't make out on the wall, as well as a tray of stuff next to the slab. Genia tries to subtly push the door open some more. 15x15 room with the marble slab in the center and a large chimney, medical instruments on the tray, and the charts also appear medical in nature. There are bloodstains on some of the medical equipment on the tray, and all over the marble slab. Charts have patient numbers and "time until death after treatments," time is in seconds. Small vent door to the chimney is slightly cracked. The slab reminds Scarlet of the kid-harvesting room in the Drow tower.

Genia attempts to use mage hand to open the chimney door. It gives a loud creak and Sebastian notices that the door has been opened. Genia is able to glimpse a handprint in the soot in the chimney. Sebastian tries to slam the door shut, but Scarlet and Teras stop him. He yells at us about breaking his trust, and insists we let him shut the door. Genia and Scarlet try to argue him down, but he won't budge, so we let him shut the door. Genia tells us what she saw, and heads downstairs the the chimney in the living room.

Sky casts [[locate-object\|locate-object]] on the totem. It is below us, slightly more towards the garden area. It seems like it's right outside of the house laterally, or maybe in the wall, but straight down. Genia doesn't see anything inside the chimney. Scarlet listens at the closed door while Sebastian cleans. Viri looks out the screen door into the garden, but doesn't see anything.

Because of the way the chimney is attached, Genia and Sky can tell that the wall housing the chimney is on is thicker than any of the other walls.

Genia crawls inside the chimney downstairs. She can see a small metal panel (about 2ft long) hanging on the wall. Opposite of it is a hole, about 8ft above Genia's head. Genia sends Scarlet a message to tell her if Sebastian leaves the room. Right then, Sebastian leaves room and insists that it's time for us to leave. He closes and locks the laboratory door behind him.

Genia climbs up to the hole and sees that it's a long chute with flickering lights at the bottom. She jumps down it, briefly sending a message to Teras about what she's doing.

Teras asks after some food, saying he's feeling rather faint, and trying to sus out if there's a cellar. Sebastian is getting increasingly irritated, he informs us that there's no basement and tries to usher us out.

Teras asks if we can roams the grounds, and Sebastian says yes and shoves us out. Teras frantically messages in every direction until he hits Genia. 

Genia falls into a hallway. There's a locked door to her right, and an altar with an open book on it at the end. She starts to walk down the hallway. There's a dead body in blue robes with the turtle totem around his neck, and a faint circle drawn around it. He is right in front of the dais. Behind the dais, there's double doors and the hallway branches. The book is actually a statue of a book with words carved into the single open "page." One hallway leads to a sarcophagus littered with coins, the other hallway turns at the end.

Upstairs, we decide to just tie Sebastian up and jump down the chimney. Viri casts hold person, and we take his key and head through the laboratory. Sebastian breaks out of his restraints and sics Gregor on us. We all make it down the chimney, just barely.

We hear a voice say, "In a whirl of blades and blood, our heroes became our martyrs. Only the Gods and the dead bear witness. We are damned, but we are saved."

Scarlet says "fuck it" and enters the circle. A magic force field keeps her stuck there. She tries to cut the circle with her rapier, Teras tries to cut it from the outside with his axe. Viri casts dispel magic (twice, first fails) and breaks the circle. Sky discerns that the wizard is alive, but very hungry and dehydrated. Sky casts spare the dying. Genia takes the locket.

Genia and Teras head down the hallway that bends, and see a short hallway with a sarcophagus at the end, six alcoves with knight statues lining the walls, and a teen lying face down in the center of the hallway.

INIT!

Rd 0
- Surprise attack from the shadows on Teras (hit, -4STR) and Genia (hit, -2STR)

Rd 1
- Genia casts mage armor on herself, she can tell the child is dead.
- Scarlet swings with her rapier twice (hit/kill, hit/kill)
- Teras attacks with his greataxe twice (hit, hit)
- Remaining shadows attack Teras (hit, hit) and Genia (miss, miss)
- Viri casts faerie fire on the two shadows in front of Teras, bardic inspo to Teras 
- Sky casts shillelagh and dashes 

Rd 2
- Genia casts eldritch blast with two beams! (hit, hit)
- Scarlet swings with her rapier (hit/kill, hit/kill)
- Teras swings with his greataxe (miss, hit/kill)
- Viri shoots with her longbow (NAT 20/kill)

Sky confirms the body is dead. Genia can tell they are an elven teen, probably a druid. The eyes are hollowed and blackened, like they've been burned out of his head. Hallway has no hidden secrets, sarcophagus has a placard in common that reads "Zarna Klavenna, may she see her husband once again." Stamped into the wood above the name is a bloody handprint, clearly larger than a child's hand.

We head back to the double doors on the other side of the altar, but can't get it open.

As we try to puzzle it out, Viri is spirited away in a whirlwind and appears in a dark pool, facing a sphinx.

### Raw Notes
- mistress payne ?
The weird butler asks us how he can help. Scarlet explains that we are looking after some missing children, and think they might've run in here to play. Sebastian insists there are no children here.

Scarlet says it's possible they're hiding and asks if we can look around. Sebastian is willing to give us a tour to prove they aren't here.

Sebstian was made by his mistress. She left to do some research, and hasn't returned in quite some time. He's been instructed to stay away from her research notes (in the study) while she's gone, and to keep the house ready for her return. He cleans every day.

Two books in the study
- a natural history of arkividros, vol. 2 by marielle the younger 
- Forsheka's Index of Deities and Other Significant Beings 

As the tour continues to the living room, Viri says she needs to piss and is directed back through the study.

Genia asks who is making the house messy if Sebastian is the only one here, and is told Gregor the dog is the one making the house messy. 

Viri steals the books from the study, and tries to read the page it was open to. It's in a very old, high elf dialect that Viri can only sort of make out. it's about some type of flower that viri can't translate.

Sebastian continues the tour upstairs, Teras pleads a fear of dogs to stay downstairs. Scarlet, Genia, and Sky go upstairs. 

Sebastian shows them his bedroom (left door upstairs), which is also where Gregor is sleeping. At least 8ft long skeletal owlbear. Apparently gregor loves company.

Middle door upstairs is miss payne's room. Normal looking bed (with an ensuite!) Wooden bedframe, but investigation check reveals a name carved into the wood: Kerek. Scarlet asks Sebastian about it, and he says he's never heard that name, but agrees it's odd that the name is carved into the post.

Genia and Teras head down the hallway that bends, and see a short hallway with a sarcophagus at the end, six alcoves with knight statues lining the walls, and a teen lying face down in the center of the hallway.
