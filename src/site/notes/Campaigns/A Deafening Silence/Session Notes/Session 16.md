### Bulleted Notes
- Sky, Zephyr, Teras, Genia, Scarlet all head to see Sebastian.
- We tell him we discovered a necromancer's lair and "long story short" we floated down a river and ended up back here. We tell him that it was the creepy cottage, and the kids seem like they wandered in there but we took care of the problem.
- Seb says they've been searching the tunnels and haven't found anything other than a cave-in heading towards the lumberyard. If we want to accuse Mr. Berr of anything we'll need watertight evidence.
- They are planning a search on Zansy's house - we can go ask Jensen to let us help out.
- Viri and Talbot scout the lumberyard. They get a decent layout of the outside, then Talbot weasel his way inside as a high-ranking official from Cape Lamar.
- He's able to meet with Mr. Lena, who says that he doesn't agree with Mr. Berr's drive to increase kuku wood production since the druids know best.
- Mr. Lena also says most workers probably wouldn't care about a regime change, but says Paul and a few others are intensely loyal to Mr. Berr.
- Viri is able to sneak inside disguised as a worker. Once inside, she disguises herself as Seb and knocks on Mr. Lena's door.
- She attempts to ask about Wood's Widow, but her attempts increasingly agitate him. They get into an intimidation-off with Viri trying to get more information and Mr. Berr trying to get "Seb" to leave.
- By the time Viri decides to leave, Mr. Berr has decided he's rather handle the problem directly. Talbot intervenes, allowing Viri to slip away and granting him access to a shared office for a private conversation with Mr. Berr.
- Mr. Berr insists there is no labor dispute and that the druids will eventually come around to increasing kuku wood production. He lies through his teeth and says he would never jeopardize the health of the forest or the relationship of the town and the druids.
- Viri tails Paul, who has left the lumberyard. When she catches up, she tries to get the location of the Wood's Widow from him, unsuccessfully. She pulls a knife and threatens to cut his balls off, and he offers up that he was going to deliver a message. The other man he was speaking to is taking it to Jensen, at Zansy's house.
- The rest of us join in the search with the Lawkeepers at Zanzy's house. It is clear that not all of the Lawkeepers are investigating very thoroughly. 
- Genia finds a deed of sale for Wood's Widow from Horace Thimble in Cape Lamar to Zansy, as well as an insurance policy for Zansy's wares on an upcoming journey.
- A messenger approaches with a note for Lt. Jensen, and upon reading it instructs the guards in the house to attack us.

### Raw Notes
Sky, Zephyr, Teras, Genia, Scarlet all head to Sebastian. Genia (NAT 20 performance) disguise kits Zephyr as we head into town. The town is fairly empty because of the recent murders, and even the lawkeeper headquarters are eerily unguarded at the moment. There is a receptionist of sorts, but the mess hall and common area seem deserted. They direct us upstairs, and we see Seb's door closed with hushed conversation behind it. Scarlet knocks and announces herself, Seb invites us in.

Seb is talking with a member of the townsguard (unremarkable), "So keep your head up, Terry. Terry was just leaving, please take a seat."

Scarlet takes the one empty seat and the rest of stand behind her. Seb asks where we were, Scarlet tells him we discovered a necromancer's lair and "long story short" we floated down a river and ended up back here. We tell him that it was the creepy cottage, and the kids seem like they wandered in there but we took care of the problem. 

Then we talk about the tunnels - Seb asks what proof we have, and Teras and Genia tell him about the letter. Seb says he's inclined to believe us, but he'll need watertight evidence that Mr. Berr is an actor. The path to Mr. Berr's office has caved in, the other four are (1. Don DeMarco's club; 2. The entrance in the grass, a house owned by a merchant named Zansy, he appears to have left town heading North (towards the druid forest, the mountains, or Thistleton/Dirshire/The Other One) last night; 3. Entrance by Ms. B's house, an employee of Don DeMarco who has denied knowledge and house search turned up nothing; 4. Under the lawkeeper's building, all townsguard claim to have no knowledge). Scarlet believe he's telling the truth that he hasn't found anything. They also search DeMarco's club during the day - the entrance to the tunnel was in the "unused storage closet," DeMarco claims he had no clue it was there. They are planning on searching Zansy's house. Jensen (his second in command) is leading the search at the moment. One guard at Don's and one at Ms. B's house to guard the tunnels.

Genia tells Seb that when Juice and Casper got mirked, they were speaking to Zansy about how things went bad with the first merchant. Seb says ther is some scheme with townsguard, Don DemArco, timber company, someone taking revenge on the people involved in the scheme. Genia says they mentioned a Zotta, Seb says he doesn't know that name. Monty did have an empty cage in his possession, but Seb said they assumed it was for an animal.

Seb asks if Scarlet made any headway on deciphering the encoded letter to the old lawmaster. 

Teras (dirty 20 history check), a while ago I saw the six-pointed star on a member of the fighting ring, someone who had "accidentally" killed another person. The name of the fighter was "Zotta." The face is the same person as on the wanted poster. The human/human combat people did have the chance to win their freedom. 

Sky and Genia roll mystery D20s. 10 and NAT 20.

- cut to Viri and Talbot 

Talbot establishes a psychic whisper connection with Viri. They scout out the lumber yard - man-made channel/river from the edge of the forest to the start of the yumber lard. There are ~6 employees running wood through the process. Talbot tries to subtly make his way towards the edge of the warehouse.  He sees two unmarked doors, and can overhear two boring work conversations. Talbot desicevely strolls towards the door on the left. Someone spots him and asks who he is - Talbot attempts to intimidate. 

"I am a high-ranking official from Cape Lamar, my business is my own, if you could direct me in the direction of Mr. Lena I would greatly appreciate it, we have things to discuss."

"First door on the right is mess hall, first door on the left tis my office (Paul Rashan, foreman), second door on the right is Mr. Lena's." 

Talbot heads to Mr. Lena's office.

Viri gets a good enough look at two of the guys heading into the forest that she can probably cast disguise self and pull it off. She "sneaks" inside to find Mr. Berr's office via the lumber yard. She goes to head through the right door, but Paul catches her, asking "George" what the fuck she's doing. She says she needs to speak to him about some time off for his daughter's birthday next week.

"Don't spook him, he's freaked out with all the assassinations going on."

Viri heads into the left door. 

Maysa | Zephyr leaves 

Talbot fey steps into Mr. Lena's office - an old man cutely snoring, office filled with books about lumber and logging, etc. Mr. Lena does not wake up at the intrusion.

Mr. Lena finally wakes up, and asks what Talbot is doing there.

"I am an emissary from Cape Lamar. I am here on behalf of my patron, the leader of Cape Lamar, Yenna. My patron has taken a special interest in the going-ons of this territory, and in particular this lumber company. I don't need to remind you of all the labor disputes that have been indelicately handled by your superior."

"i invite you to speak freely, and be assured your testimony will have no impact on you. What would you do differently if you were in your superior's shoes."

Mr. Lena says he'd extend the lunch hour. Talbot asks about the druids.

"Unless we have a specific directive from Cape Lamar to expand production, I think we should honor our original agreement with the druids" because they've done a lot of work and research into the most sustainable amount of wood they can give us. "I'd look into places with a similar climate where we could grow more kuku wood." Mr. Berr says there's a value in having a monopoly on the wood. 

Mr. Lena says he's not sure My. Berr would ever step down, but he'd take up his position if he did. Talbot asks if he'd have the support of the workers if Mr. Berr stepped down, and Mr. Lena says there's a few people he'd need to replace but most of them would probably be fine with it. He specifically names Paul, and "some of his guys."

If I were you, I'd erase any memory of this conversation and within the next 24 to 48 hours if you find yourself in the position to lead this company, consider it good fortune. Consider the bonus that may be sent your way from Cape Lamar, if the transition is smooth, to be similar good fortune.

"I catch your drift, I think this was all a dream." He puts his head on the desk and snores lightly.

"Jerry Lena"

Viri sees an office for "Ger Mookin, foreman" and the next door is "Tim Berr, director." She tries to listen through the door, and she can hear noise but can't make anything out. She drops her current disguise self and changes into Seb. She knocks on the door and a gruff voice calls out "Who's there." Viri just knocks again.

She says she's Seb, and Mr. Berr says get the fuck out, you shouldn't be in here. Viri says things have changed, open the door or face the consequences. "How have things changed. "LEt me in and i'll tell you all about it"

Mr. Berr opens the door and attempts to leave the office and swing it shut behind him. Viri tries to stick a hand out and stop the door. Viri grabs his arm and stops him. 

"I told you, I don't want any trouble." '"What do you want?" "I want to discuss something my men found earlier today, and I'd prefer to discuss it in the comfort of my office."

Viri asks about Wood's Widow, which Mr. Berr denies knowing anything about. Viri threatens him with spending some time in jail, and Mr. Berr begins to threaten Seb, telling him to get out and stop threatening Mr. Berr.

Jerry runs out of his office, Talbot teleports as far away from the offices as he can. He can see one person in the mess hall, who does not seem to notice him. She psychic messages Viri and says "Mr. Lena is aware of his role, it is time we take our leave."

Viri can tell Mr. Berr knows more than he's letting on, and offers to cut him a deal if he tells him everything he knows. "How about this deal, never show your face around here again and I'll let you keep your face the way that it is." is Mr. Berr's response. 

Viri threatens Mr. Berr again, and then tries to leave. Talbot psychically asks if she learned anything useful, to which she replies Wood's Widow is real and he knows about it, but they should question him when he calms down.

Paul calls in backups, who all try to block Viri from leaving. Talbot strides towards Mr. Berr and introduces himself as an employee of Yenna. Mr. Berr says Yenna doesn't directly oversee the timber company, but Talbot says she has a vested interest in his business. He says he's a bit shaken by an officer of the law attempting an unlawful investigation of the premises, so he needs a moment before he invites Talbot in for a chat. It sounds like he is writing something, and indeed he emerges with a letter in his hand and heads down the hallway. 

Viri escapes, finds somewhere to hide, drops disguise self, and tries to find a spot where she can see what's going on in the warehouse. 

Mr. Berr attempts to direct Talbot to the shared office, not his personal office. Talbot explains he is here for : 1. people in cape lamar concerned about resolving the labor dispute; 2. if a dispute is resolved successfully, is this resolution a replicable method to be used elsewhere? Mr. berr asks if he plays dragonchess, Mr. Envers says yes. Talbot guesses that he is asking some sort of code phrase, but evidently he has not passed the test as Mr. Berr seems to close off. 

"It's not a labor dispute, they all work very hard when we're not interrupted by intruders. We do have the dispute with the druids, I believe we have an opportunity to increase our profits and those of the royal families, by increasing the production of kuku wood. The druids are not interested in any of our offers so far, but our negotatiosn continue and I have confidence that the druids will eventually come around to our point of view. I'm not sure I'm employing any unique negotiation tactics, so I am not sure they are of interest to you." He reassures Talbot that he would take no actions that would jeapordazie the forest, the relationship of Wheaton with the cape, or jeapordize their relationship with the druids.

Talbot can tell he's blowing smoke up his ass. "I have heard you have a unique negotiating tactic for weakening the negotiations, or constitutions, of the druids."

Mr. Berr assures him he and every member of the company reject wholeheartedly any efforts to harm the druids or their environment as part of these negotiations. Talbot asks when the negotiations might be done, and Mr. Berr says tonight. He invites Talbot to come along, and assures him they are taking many precautions due to the assassin on the loose. He asks if Talbot in investigation them too, which Talbot says he is. 

Viri tries to tail Paul and (someone) as they leave, so they split up and start sprinting. Paul asks what the fuck Viri wants, and she says she just wants to talk to him. He stops and asks what she wants to talk about. Viri says she knows he knows where the Wood's Widow is, and he better tell her. Paul says he has no idea what she's talking about. She asks why he was running, and he says because someone was following her. 

Talbot catches up and says he's also interested in the Wood's Widow, and when Paul says he doesn't know anything Talbot thinks he's telling the truth. Paul says he's going to the tool store, Talbot thinks he's lying or partially lying. 

Viri pulls a dagger, presses it to his thigh, and threatens to cut his balls off if he doesn't say where he's going. Paul says he's going to deliver a message. Talbot asks him to hand it over, and Paul says the other guy has it. It's to be delivered to Jensen, who will be at Zansy's and not at the lawkeeper's headquarters.

- cut to the rest of us 

The lawkeepers watch as we approach, a red dragonborn steps forward and says "Hello, how can I help you?" Scarlet says we were sent by Seb to aid in the investigation. Genia asks his name, which is Jensen. There is also Sarah (female human), Patrice (male half-elf), Mink (female Tabaxi), Gorlach (male half-orc), Marcie (female gnome), Zac (male human). 

Jensen asks if we are aware of the tunnel updates and Zansy's expected involvement in...something. Scarlet confirms and asks how we should divvy up. Sarah, Patrice, and Mink go upstairs with Sky and Genia. Gorlach, Marcy, Jensen, Scarlet, and Teras take the first floor. Teras volunteers to look outside first.

First floor has a cooking area, living room, and hallway with doors on either side, as well as a staircase. Second floor has a landing, a single hallway with three doors. 

Teras finds nothing else of note outside. For the most part, people are staying off the streets.

Genia finds something in an area Patrice was supposed to have search, suspects perhaps the search is a little half-assed. It is a deed of sale for Wood's Widow from Horace Thimble in Cape Lamar to Zansy. She also finds a document from Cliff's Complete Coverage verifying insurance of Zansy's wares for his trips from CL -> Thistleton. A payout if he loses his wares, up to 5,000gp.

Gorlach finds a full list of inventory for Zansy's load - traveling from Cape Lamar to Thistleton. 

As we investigate, someone approaches the front door and asks for Lt. Jensen. A letter from Mr. Berr detailing his willingness to cooperate with the ongoing investigation. Teras and Scarlet question why it didn't go to Sebastian, and the messenger says Mr. Berr requested Jensen read it straight away. Teras picks up nothing with his insight check.

To the messenger boy - "Very well," into the room, "guards, it's time."

ROLL INIT! (next week)

Talbot and Viri will arrive in Rd 2. Sky and Genia are surprised by the combat (also "arrive" in Rd. 2).
