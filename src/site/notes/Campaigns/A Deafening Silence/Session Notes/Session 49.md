### Edited Long-Form Notes 

### Raw Notes
Zippy tells us we need to decide what to do next fast, there are orcs coming to our location. We debate whether or not to surrender or go back a floor and rest. We decide to do a quick scan of this floor for any missing soldiers, and then rest a floor above before heading back down.

Teras, Genia, and Talbot do a search. I find a rusty bloodrage greataxe that will need to be restored before use. Genia finds some money, Talbot finds one body and one more unconscious solider. The elevator begins to rise, and Genia and Teras destroy the lever on this floor that would call the elevator down as we hear footsteps begin to head towards us.

Zippy informs us that the orcs can move through stone, so we need to camp outside of the mines. As we leave, we can tell it is almost dawn and so we should be safe. 

Teras, Zephyr, and Scarlet return the unconscious expedition members while everyone else sets up camp. Viri asks Tiri how she's been. She says she's been learning a lot, but she can't do Zippy's rope trick yet.

talbot and Teras have a heart to heart. We check in with Zippy and introduce he and Talbot. On their watch, Genia feels some deep shaking in the earth, then hears a weird rumbling echo from the mines. After a conversation between Genia and Viri, they hear a rumbling and clanking sound that sounds like the elevator, and then hear footsteps and a dragging sound. 

Genia and Viri see an armor clad figure limping towards them with a staff used to prop themself up. They debate what to do, and Viri calls out "Stop! Who are you?" The figure looks up but continues moving forward. Something flies through the air and hits the back of the figure, who cries out but tries to pull forward. Another dart hits and the figure falls, his helmet comes off and Viri can see that it is Kylian. They both rush forward to grab him, and the blow dart says "Stop! Step away from this vile creature."

"You're his companions?" "Yes" "In the name of Lumen, I declare you enemies of the Empire and sentence you to die."
