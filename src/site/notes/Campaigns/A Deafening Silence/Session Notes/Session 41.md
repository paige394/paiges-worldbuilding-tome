### Bulleted Notes

### Edited Long-Form Notes 

### Raw Notes
The inn owner comes to furiously kick us out and demand 50gp. We leave, and Skye tosses them 2 platinum. The innkeep says we will regret our behavior, but gives us an owl with a letter from Zippy.

Zippy gives us updates on Tiri, tells us agents of the cult are headed to the mines of Chdecken to get the staff, so Zippy will also be heading there. The owl knows where he is if we want to respond.

Scarlet tells him we're also heading to the mines and hopefully we will see him there.

We split up and head to the mob and casino, respectively.

Genia, Scarlet, and Zephyr head to the mob, at The Tinkle. They sit at a table and wait when they arrive. They finally head to the bar and ask for Mr. Grey, but the barkeep tries to kick them out. "Don't fuck with the innkeeps!"

He points Genia to a warehouse, and the gang heads back there. A men steps forward and Cash introduces himself as Cash, and says he's here on behalf of Mr. Grey. Genia asks for proof of life for Cynthia, and Cash says he needs proof of the payment. Genia gives him the bags, and Cash says that this is acceptable payment. He says, "Let me send you on your way," and pulls out a key, heading to the door. He unlocks the door and lets them go.

Genia says she hopes she never sees him again, and Cash says, "Oh wait! Where's the Milky Menace?"

Teras, Viri, Skye, and Talbot head to the casino. Talbot warns us that he will have to use an alias here, as he is not well liked at the Casino. His alias is "Marsian Seeple."

Teras notices that the door we are headed towards is already open, and there is some flickering light underneath it. "Genia" goes first, and she hears a squish as she enters. Beneath her is a dead body, face down, and further into the room we hear a familiar voice.

"You're late," Zotta, Zephyr's sister greets us. 

"I think I'm right on time," Viri says.

"Genia, right? I got wind that these folks wanted to deal with you and decided to lend a hand. But let's just say that the mayor...he's mine."

"What business do you have with the mayor?" Teras asks. She says similar business that I have with Baxter.

We leave out the window, and Teras says he needs to talk to Genia.

Genia doesn't really care about the revelation, and seems enraged that Zotta might steal her kill. 

We head to Twyla and get our carriage, and she volunteers as our carriage driver. As we travel, Genia offers up Viri her tragic backstory, Trandor and all. Viri tells her to be careful with patrons.

Zephyr and Twyla have some very odd conversation before we stop for the night.

During our next day of travel, the Count send Genia a message in the morning. "Glad to hear the meeting was successful. Will speak with the mayor shortly and let you know his plans."

Genia responds, "Yep, all good. Did Jeeves tell you our question about mayor and assassin? Also, tell Jeeves Twyla is into him."

In the afternoon, we pass by some small farm town with fruit sellors and a few wandering folk. Nothing of event happens.

Skye asks Twyla how to drive the carriage. Twyla asks if Skye is trying to put her out of a job, and Skye just says they would like to learn in case they need it. Twyla obliges, and lectures them about the caring and keeping of your equipment. The conversation takes a turn to relationships.

During the night, Talbot notices the horses making some stress noises, and then he feels some slight tremors in the ground. Once it passes, the horses calm. 

Scarlet and Skye on second watch notice the same thing. Slight tremors, not enough to wake anyone up, but it happens repeatedly. Skye casts [[divination\|divination]] and asks what is causing the rumbling. A deep, rumbling voice answers, "The world quakes as it returns."

Viri and Teras don't feel any tremors for most of the night. Teras asks for reassurance that he's a good person, saying he feels like there's monster in him that might break out one day and not be put back away. Viri offers him some words of comfort.

Right as the sun rises, a series of violent tremors wakes everyone up, except Skye.

Skye is dreaming, a familiar scene. Praying in a temple to Repara, having a pleasant conversation. All of a sudden, they begin to feel a sense of dread overcoming them, not from them but from Repara. She goes silent as the doors to the temple explode in, Skye turns to look and sees a familiar face grinning ear-to-ear, the face of Count Hen von Himm. The Count says, "You have chosen the wrong side." He raises his hand, and black tendrils reach out towards Skye as they take psychic damage.

Skye's body begins to shake and their eyes go black, and then they jolt awake and black tendrils begin to crawl out of their eyes, forming shapes in the air next to them. The shapes take on the form of two rotting, undead black dragons, a man wearing a mask standing in front of them, and two men flanking him.
