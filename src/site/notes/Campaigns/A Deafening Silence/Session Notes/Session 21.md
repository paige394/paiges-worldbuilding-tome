### Bulleted Notes
- Teras and Talbot dream of real memories, with no remarkable changes 
- Genia dreams of the day she met her patron, but at the end is attacked by inky black tentacles
- The cabin wakes to Vanyo convulsing on the floor next to Genia's bed
- Vanyo is moved to the healers' cabins, and Marge questions if anything strange happened to us while we slept 
- We discuss next steps and agree to travel to Cape Lamar as a group, planning to travel with Talbot via teleportation circle 
- Viri receives her kuku wood from the druids, and receives a sending stone from Marge in case there's further trouble
- Marge speaks to Genia alone and warns her that there is a darkness following her; she gifts Genia a [[cursed-luckstone-gos\|cursed-luckstone-gos]] 
- Scarlet and Teras go speak to Seb before leaving
- Scarlet asks for advice on being an ex-Lightkeeper, Seb's advice is to just lay low and hope 

Marge asks Genia if they can speak alone for a moment. Genia asks if she's in trouble and Marge says perhaps, but not with her. "I wanted to let you know that what happened this morning was not your fault, but there is a darkness following you. The world always seeks balance, and while we can tip the balance in our favor in time we will come crashing down in return to that balance. That is how the druids see the world." She gives Genia a single stone, "This stone is a reminder about the double-sided nature of violating the world's natural balance. The world itself takes time to restore balance, but the gods...fate, is far quicker." It's a [[cursed-luckstone-gos\|cursed-luckstone-gos]]. Genia leaves.

Scarlet and Teras head to Seb. He's asleep on his desk but Scarlet knocks him awake. "What the fuck! Why'd you wake me up so early?" Scarlet says we're leaving, she wanted to say goodbye and ask a question.

"You'll be pleased to know that the injured Lawkeepers survived their injuries and are expected to make a full recovery." 

Scarlet shuts the door and asks if he wants some tea. He says no. "I fucked up pretty bad, and I don't regret what I did but now I'm between a rock and a hard place. You've left the lightkeepers and are in a different stage and...I'm realizing a lot of the things I was taugh are kind of fucked up. How do I separate myself from that, as somone who's done it? I don't want to feel like I'm on the run for the rest of my life."

Seb suggests keeping a lower profile than he has and says, "Sometimes shit just finds ya, right?" Keep your head on a swivel, use a new name, at least around Lightkeepers. The Empire and the surrounding regions aren't on good terms, so if you're far South they won't really give a shit, aren't gonna turn you in or anything. 

"Do you still have any connections in the Lightkeepers?"  He says you get up and leave and don't really look back, so no. You could try for "George T." one of Seb's old mentors when he was an up-and-comer in the Lightkeepers. He never seemed particularly invested in the whole mission.  Last I heard he had moved to Thistleton - he wanted to be a fisher so he's probably near some water.

Sky visits the temple of Repara - there is some sort of farmer's market going on. Word has gotten out that whatever danger was here has been dealt with, and the streets are busy once again. Sky attempts to deepen their connection with Repara, although the bustle and clamor in the temple makes it difficult.  They feel nothing in the back of their head, which is a little unnerving since two of the three voices don't seem to be present at all. Sky tells Repara about the dream they had a few days ago, and asks about an elvish man that's creepy and in their head and they want to know about him. "Perhaps a champion of another?" Repara suggests.

Sky approaches a (priest?) and asks if they know of an elvish man who's rather pretty that comes to people in dreams and has, in the past, taken the form of Repara. "Besides my ex-husband? No, sorry." They ask if the man resembled Repara because they have a connection to her or some sort of deception. Sky says definitely deception, and the priest says it would need to be a powerful entity to visit you in your dreams. They will stay on the lookout for charming and deceitful elvish men. Sky thanks them and leaves.

Teras asks Seb about Plintus Zinstra. Seb asks how they wronged me, and I told him. "I do think the blight of corruption goes all the way to the top, but Janeus is the worst apple I encountered. Lot of people who retired early and had a bit too much money often didn't stay in the Empire. They left and settled all over the place. Keep looking around, I'm sure you'll find more of us." Teras asks if he can give him anything else. Seb remembers - George Tramwell, you could look for him. Half-elf, bit over 6' tall, he might still know some better apples. In Cape Lamar specifically, active Lightkeepers aren't allowed in the city but someone retired can enter. I've heard of a tavern that connects former Lightkeepers together - The Gleaming Shield. Probably worse apples hanging out here. 

Vic Sartosa was always a proponent of expanding Lightkeeper operations as much as possible, areas like Thistleton were always in contention on whether they should provide more services. There's still marauding parties in the mountains to the West of Thistleton. If you're looking to head to the West, Traxeldorf is NW out of Wheaton prior to the three towns, mostly a mining town, fairly removed from the politics of the mainland. Place where a lot of those marauders might visit, trade with, etc. The summer solstice (end of June) is always a big thing for the Lightkeepers or Lumen worshippers.

Teras asks how Seb got in with the Lightkeepers. They're supposed to keep the peace in the empire, expand the Empire, and share Lumen's light with the world. You join because you're good at it or you don't have any other options.

Scarlet asks how to get rid of a Revenant. Seb says keep him captive and bring him to a powerful priest.

Talbot says they shouldn't travel with the Earl because he will be traveling directly to the manor of Count Henn von Himm, and he thinks that would be rather rude of them. Viri asks if it's okay if the Earl says it's ok? Talbot says he's much more concerned with the Count's opinion than the Earl's. He is not someone who appreciates unwanted intrusions. He offers to bring us along with him after the Earl departs, and we can travel in a more general location. Viri says she's traveling with the Earl and the rest of us can do whatever we want.

Genia says some members of the party would probably like to keep a low profile, so appearing in the home of the Count is maybe not the wisest choice. 

Zephyr asks how Talbot knows this, and he says his patron (one of the Noble Pantheon) informed him where the Earl would be traveling. Viri says she thinks she gets what's going on now. Genia asks if Talbot is a cop, and he says "I do whatever role is needed." Viri says "you do whatever your patron wants and it pisses off von Himm." Genia asks if he would massage his patron's feet, and Talbot says his work is only done to benefit the city and not just his patron. Genia says "Ok, so only if you give everybody foot massages."

Genia asks if his patron decides what's for the good of Cape Lamar. Talbot asks if that's not what leaders are supposed to do. He confirms he is "an operative of the Noble Pantheon" when Genia asks if he only works for the one patron then.

Viri asks if he knows house Trevail. He says yes, but it's not his patron's house. The families all work together for the benefit of the Cape. Viri says she had someone very close to her taken, and she thinks Trevail may be have him. She intends to find him when they get to Cape Lamar, his name is Kylian. Talbot asks what his accused crime was, and Viri says she has no idea, they aren't from around here, but they branded him with their house symbol.

OOC knowledge for Talbot: When criminals are arrested and sentenced to The Catacombs, they are branded, but it would not be with the symbol of a house. The brand is removed magically when your parole/sentence ends. Talbot does not specifically remember House Trevail doing this, but he knows that one way mind control magic is utilized/extended is through a brand. 

IC: Talbot says he is not aware of any particular house doing this, but it's troubling information indeed.

As they approach the Earl, they can hear someone screaming profanities and running around the house (sounds like the Earl). Viri knocks on the door. "Oh shit, Viri! Come in, door's unlocked."

The interior of the house is strewn with clothes and other personal items - looks like last-minute packing. Viri picks up a bracelet and asks him where he got it. "Don't touch that! It might explode!"

He comes around the corner, "Do I owe you something?" "The lute." He says he doesn't have time to make it right now, but if we're coming to Cape Lamar... Viri asks why he's in a hurry. "I've got an appointment with Doug!" (The wizard.) Viri is impatient and asks if he can push his appointment back. 

"No I can't! Doug fuckin wanders. You show up ten minutes late and he's off smelling flowers." The Earl says he'll make Viri a lute in Cape Lamar. Viri asks where in Cape Lamar he's headed, and he confirms he'll be arriving in the Count's manor in the upper ward. Viri asks if he can give her a second. His appointment is in an hour, we can be there or not. We can pick up the lute in Cape Lamar or in a week in Wheaton or whatever. Viri asks if she can bum some grass, and also says she needs to see him make the lute so she'll definitely be in Cape Lamar.

Scarlet, Teras, and Sky have all arrived. Viri explains the situation. Genia pipes up about traveling without the Earl, directly into the Count's home. We discuss the merits of Earl versus no Earl versus Druids. We decide to attempt to travel with the Earl.

Viri asks if we can tweak our arrival location. The Earl says if we're scared of the Count he probably won't be there, it'll just be an attendant. We'll just be there as The Earl's guests, something he's done many times before. Viri asks if he could persuade Doug to take a second group, and Earl says he's not in the habit of making promises he can't keep, and he doesn't want to get on the bad side of a wizard.

We head to the Royal Wizard. There is a storefront with lots of magic components, with a tall blonde human woman standing behind the counter. The Earl asks after Doug, and the woman (Meridith) says she'll go look for him. Genia asks if there's a vibe between the Earl and Meridith. 

Footsteps, then a small orangey-green-brown hand with three clawed fingers. Doug pulls himself up to standing on the counter, dressed in an elegant blue robe with purple and red stripes that falls to the ground and billows, with a large wizard hat (blue with white stars of course). Cracked skin, beady yellow eyes, a large set of spectacles. Doug, the Goblin wizard of Wheaton.

Doug had an unexpected guest this morning who needed to teleport, so his appointment is pushed back. He will be ready in three hours. The Earl asks if "Eerie Viri" and her compatriots can join him on the trip. Doug says the reservation is only for one, why should he make an exception? He's got a vacancy in eight weeks that we could take. Viri asks if Doug is a fan of the Earl, and says she's studying under him. She's working on new music when they get to Cape Lamar, and she says she's thinking about a song about a wizard, and maybe Doug could be the muse for her next song if he tells her a little bit about himself. He add one person to the list. 

We schmooze Doug a bit. He says he can take us all, but he'll need a little extra payment and a performance. Viri offers up her kuku wood. He says two bundles would do it. Viri confirms the Earl only needs two, and gives the other two to Doug. He hands them off to Meridith to store.

"I'm about to rock your fuckin' socks off." Viri says.

Doug takes us to the basement to prepare and perform. 

The Earl asks about the surprise appointment, and Doug says it was confidential...except to Jameson. He whispers it, but Talbot overhears, "Mr. DeMarco."

Douglas Merton starts to prepare the circle and asks Viri to play while he does. She wracks her mind for some ballads and sings a song called "The Bramble Briar" about an illicit love affair between a noble and a nearby servant woman from a different house. Doug is sobbing by the end of it. "That was beautiful!"

As the teleportation spell swirls around us, Teras looks to his left and at the edge of our teleportation I see a shadowy figure, cloaked with the burning light of the end of a cigarette. "I'm impressed by your work so far, but where you're going, well, you might be exploring the darkness." They toss me something - a pair of goggles. 

We're in a stone room with a teleportation circle. Red drapes with golden edges, a golden wave sigil is embroidered on the curtains. Teras is wearing the goggles. They are the [[goggles-of-night\|goggles-of-night]].

### Edited Long-Form Notes 

### Raw Notes
Teras, Genia, Talbot have some interesting "dreams."

Talbot - A blustering summer's day in Cape Lamar, specifically the dock ward. Wearing plain, tattered clothes, the uniform of a dock worker. Remebering a previous contract you had taken on a few years ago - investigationg a man named Cyrus Dockson (captain of Seaman's Swell, fishing vessel that operated under royal charter.)  Mission was to investigate Cyrus, suspected of spreading anti-royal messages amongst his crew and perhaps others in the dock ward. Political revolutionary/dissident. On this day, lloadign crates onto the Seamsen's swell that had previously contained fish and other ocean goodies. Fish had been taken and sold, Talbot is returning the crates to the boat. You remeber that as you loaded some of the crates, some were conspicously heavy for "empty" wooden crates. You were curious, but it would look very strange for a dock worker to pry a crate open. Asks a stocky, dwarven fellow workman why the crates were so heavy, dwarf shurgged. Quickly turned attention to a convo between Cyrus and his crew - after having returned and dropped off his catch at the royal storehouse that operated the charter, he spoke to his crew "Well men, after the fee for the royal charter and expenses to maintain the boat and so on and so forth in supplies in that, we're down to ten gold to a man." Whining and grumbling amongst the crew. "I know I know, but take up your squabbles with the king I guess, apparently there was another shipment that came in day before last and so, a bit too much in supply. We'll more than make up for it on this venture, if you know what I mean." He winks at the crew. Cyrus returned ina few weeks and Tablot had wormed his way into the political aspect of the dock ward - the Tempest, a political revolutionary group committed to challenging the rule of the monarchy in the cape. He exposed Cyrus' invovlement in the group and sent him and a bunch of his collaborators to the Catacombs.

Teras - You begin to recall a day even longer ago, many years, about six months after your capture after you'd had enough time to recover. The first day of my training. I am standing outside ona crsip, windy, fall afternoon in the fields behind one of Baxter's many properties in Thistleton. I'm face to face with a well-dressed, half-elven man anmed Jorge. Tall, a bit over six feet with a staff on his shoulder, apprasing me as I stand awkardly with my harness. He tuts up and down, looking at me, shakes his head, "Alright, well. Show me your stance." I try to adopt my best fighters stance, remmebering my timw iwth the Mountain Marauders. The elf jabs with his staff and pushes me off balance. "That will not do." He demonstrates the proper stance for maintinng my weight and balance in a fight. As I continue to get exasperated with my situation he says, "Teras, you can kill me when you're ready, but for now, we share a goal: keeping you alive. Now show me your stance." The rest of the afternoon he pokes and prods at me until I perfect my stance. 

Genia - A day a while ago coming home from school w her best friend who has to run off bc her sister, Hannah, said she was going to travel the world someday and needed to know how to sail so they were goin g on lake thistleton. Genia goes to her garden at home to check on them, there's an old lady facedown and sweltering. You recall the encounter vividly. As she begins to walk off, you feel as though the memory is twisting, and it's no longer you acting. You feel questions coming from your body but not from your will, asking pointed questions toward the lady. "Who are you? Why is there darkness following you?" The old lady turns around and looks at you with piercing eyes. "What have you done?" Genia asks. The old lady looks, tilts her head, and squints. She explodes into a tangle of black inky coils that shoot towards Genia, as they begin to envelope you you startle awake. 

We all wake up as we hear a constant knocking and shaking. On the ground next to Genia's bed is Vanyo, convulsing on the ground of our cabin. Teras runs out to yell for help, Genia and Talbot try to check on her. Her body is trying to resist some sort of magical control, spell, condition, etc. 

The druid encampment awakens, including the rest of our party. Marge addresses teras than heads towards the cabin when he says Vanyo is in trouble. She sees Vanyo and starts to cast a spell, green coils of light envelop Vanyo and the convulsing begins to slow and she comes to a rest. 

"Is she okay?" Genia asks. Marge says only time will tell. She does not know what overtook Vanyo or why she was in this cabin. We move her to one of the healers' cabins.

Teras asks if the kid will be taken care of, and Marge says she will. She asks Teras if anything strange happened last night, and he says they were all so tired they just kind of passed out.

Back at the cabin, Marge asks Genia and Talbot if they had any strange dreams. They says just some memories. Genia asks if there's something she's looking for, and Marge just replies "anything out of the ordinary." 

Marge excuses herself, telling Genia she'd like to speak with her before they leave. 

We talk about what to do next, and conclude that we'll travel to Cape Lamar as a group. Talbot should be able to get us all through one of the teleportation circles.

Viri needs her kuku wood and wants to talk to the Earl before we leave.

Talbot knows the Ball the Earl is playing at will be hosted by the merchant spot, currently held by the Count. (Five rulers in Cape Lamar, fifth is always held by the richest merchant in the city.)

Talbot messages their patron to inform them of the situation and saying who they are coming with.

Genia and Sky roll d20s. No result.

Sky, Talbot, Zephyr, Genia, Viri all head to Marge. Viri asks Marge about the kuku wood, and she signals to a young elvish woman in her early twenties . She brings four bundles of kuku wood (~100gp/bundle if you sell to the right person.) Viri asks what's so special about the kuku wood. Marge explains it's a stronger wood than most traditional sources, not in the physical sense but as a conduit for magic. Particularly well-suited for harboring spells for enchantment and the like. 

Viri thanks her and asks if she thinks the new logging leader will stay true to their word. She says to contact her if they give her any problems. Marge thanks her and says she hopes things will stay peaceful, but gives Viri a sending stone. She also reiterates that she's happy to take us anywhere we wish.

Marge asks Genia if they can speak alone for a moment. Genia asks if she's in trouble and Marge says perhaps, but not with her. "I wanted to let you know that what happened this morning was not your fault, but there is a darkness following you. The world always seeks balance, and while we can tip the balance in our favor in time we will come crashing down in return to that balance. That is how the druids see the world." She gives Genia a single stone, "This stone is a reminder about the double-sided nature of violating the world's natural balance. The world itself takes time to restore balance, but the gods...fate, is far quicker." It's a [[cursed-luckstone-gos\|cursed-luckstone-gos]]. Genia leaves.

Scarlet and Teras head to Seb. He's asleep on his desk but Scarlet knocks him awake. "What the fuck! Why'd you wake me up so early?" Scarlet says we're leaving, she wanted to say goodbye and ask a question.

"You'll be pleased to know that the injured Lawkeepers survived their injuries and are expected to make a full recovery." 

Scarlet shuts the door and asks if he wants some tea. He says no. "I fucked up pretty bad, and I don't regret what I did but now I'm between a rock and a hard place. You've left the lightkeepers and are in a different stage and...I'm realizing a lot of the things I was taugh are kind of fucked up. How do I separate myself from that, as somone who's done it?

"Do you still have any connections in the Lightkeepers?"  He says you get up and leave and don't really look back, so no. You could try for "George T." one of Seb's old mentors when he was an up-and-comer in the Lightkeepers. He never seemed particularly invested in the whole mission.  Last I heard he had moved to Thistleton - he wanted to be a fisher so he's probably near some water.

Sky visits the temple of Repara - there is some sort of farmer's market going on. Word has gotten out that whatever danger was here has been dealt with, and the streets are busy once again. Sky attempts to deepen their connection with Repara, although the bustle and clamor in the temple makes it difficult.

Sky says definitely deception, and the priest says it would need to be a powerful entity to visit you in your dreams. They will stay on the lookout for charming and deceitful elvish men. Sky thanks them and leaves.

Teras asks Seb about Plintus Zinstra. Seb asks how they wronged me, and I told him. "I do think the blight of corruption goes all the way to the top, but Janeus is the worst apple I encountered.
