### Bulleted Notes
- Marge asks Zephyr where she's been, she says "out and about" and introduces us all
- Genia asks Marge about the missing kids - 3 missing, probably located in the abandoned cottage were "something terrible happened" once upon a time 
- The cottage has wards, and the druids normally have totems that allow passage but Marge rented the last one to a wizard investigating The Seven 
- If we can return the kids, Marge will give us some kuku wood 
- There's also an underground river that runs next to the cottage that we could use to get in
- We tell Marge about Mr. Berr's possible poisoning, and she tells use they are meeting tomorrow night to discuss the kuku wood supply, which would be an excellent time for someone to investigate Mr. Berr while he's out 
- We head for the cottage, and get attacked by a bunch of crocodiles (and a giant Croc)
- After a short rest, we press on and discover the small cottage, only to be attacked again by a shambling mound and some [[will-o-wisp\|will-o-wisp]]s
- Zephyr and Genia both get absorbed, but are rescued successfully and the monsters are all killed 
- During a break for Sky to cast prayer of healing, we investigate the cottage and find a broken window large enough for a child to climb into
- We can't break the window further, so we enter through the front door and are greeted by a Frankenstein's-monster-like being

### Edited Long-Form Notes 
Absent: Aoife|Sophie 

Zephyr asks how Marge knows it was her even though she's blind, and Marge responds that she "knows every set of feet that sets foot in my forest." She also tells Zephyr her parents have been worried sick and asks where she was, and Zephyr replies she was just "out and about" to avoid the wanted posters. She introduces us as "some people she met along the way." 

Genia asks about the missing kids. Marge says they've lost 3 members of their group. Zephyr asks if she knows what happened, and Marge asks why that's our business. Zephyr says she thinks she deserves to know as a member of the community. Genia pipes in that we want to help.

Marge tells us about the abandoned cottage to the West (~1.5hrs on foot). It is older than Marge, and it is said that something terrible happened there once. So the druids of the forest built a ward around the cottage to keep whatever was in there from getting out. She's heard reports of renewed activity recently - lights, strange noises, and a fog hanging over the area. She suspects the missing children will be found somewhere in that area. 

Genia asks if she thinks the kids wandered in there, or if something took them. Marge says she isn't sure, but the ward still holds and nothing can exit without permission. The druids normally have some totems they can give to people as their "permission," but Marge recently sold the last totem to a mage who was investigating the history of the continent and specifically "The Seven." He wanted to rent the totem as he thought the house may have information about The Seven. Genia asks if it's Forsheka, and Marge says it couldn't be Forsheka as he is much too old. Marge also offers up that if we can find out the fate of the children she will supply us with some kuku wood.

Teras brings up the possibility of the druids being poisoned by Mr. Berr and his associates, and mentions that Sebastian is trying to offer an olive branch and so perhaps Marge could speak to him. There is further discussion about what this means and if we have proof of our claims.

Tomorrow night, Marge and Mr. Berr are having a meeting to discuss the supply of kuku wood. She suggests this would be an excellent time for an "unassociated group of individuals" to investigate the poisoning claims further. 

Marge tells us that if we follow the river, when it begins to run underground it runs right next to the cottage. The ward only holds aboveground, so it might be an alternative route in if we cannot find the totems.

We head out of Marge's house in a vaguely Northwesterly direction. Sky is able to safely navigate us in the correct direction. They notice some signs of other people having traveled through this way recently, but not enough to be able to track. Sky sees a shimmering fog ahead in the distance. They cast locate object on the totem, and being to get a vague read. As we forge ahead, Viri and Scarlet notice what appear to be floating logs, and as we get close see floating white half circles attached to the logs. They begin to move rapidly towards us. We prepare for battle.

We take a short rest. Viri plays a lovely song of rest for us. Noise begins to return to the forest, scavengers appear to begin picking the crocs clean.

Sky's locate object is now pointing directly to the center of the island. We head into the fog. There's an old, decrepit, decaying, wood-and-brick two-story cottage in the wards. The second floor is not the full size of the first floor. The door is directly in front of where we stepped into the ward. It is in remarkably good shape for being centuries old, despite the overgrowth of vines. We are standing on a tangled mess of moss and vines as we walk forward. We do not notice any clear signs of life, but do see some floating balls of light drifting in a circular direction around the house. Genia can tell that there is an odd patch of vines to the right of the door that looks slightly sunken in or unattached from the moss and vines around it.

Genia uses her mage hand to push on the vine patch. The hand sinks in, and then the area begins to rise up and up and up. 

Roll initiative!

- Scarlet activates her crimson rite on her crossbow and fires (hit)

- The mound slams the wolf (hit, hit) and pulls wolf-Zephyr into it's chest

Rd 2
- Scarlet fires her crossbow (hit on Zephyr)
- Zephyr takes a bunch of damage, un-wolfs, wild shapes into a bear and breaks free from the mound
- The floating lights blink out of existence
- Sky hits the mound (miss)
- Teras lightnings (fail) and swings with his axe (hit)

- Scarlet shoots with her crossbow (hit)

- The orb attacks Viri (Nat 1, attack of opportunity back)
- Sky swings at the mound (hit/NAT 20)
- Teras pulls Genia out of the mound 
- Viri attacks the orb (miss) and heals herself
- Genia eldritch blasts (hit on AC)
- The mound swings at Teras (miss, miss)

Rd 5
- Scarlet crossbows the mound (hit/kill)
- Zephyr claws at the orb (miss)
- The orb attacks Viri (hit on AC) 
- Sky climbs up onto the roof 
- Teras throws a javelin at the final orb (NAT20/kill)

Viri tries to take a look around up on the roof but doesn't see much. The fog is one-way however, so she can see back out into the swamp we came from. Teras gathers Genia in a crushing hug. She asks Sky for some healing, who says they are out but if we stop for ten minutes they can do some healing. Sky begins to cast prayer of healing.

Scarlet and Teras investigate the mound, finding some animal bones and not much else. The island we are on is ~250ft across. Scarlet and Viri investigate this side of the island while Sky recites their prayer. They notice a few broken-off pieces of trellis and the bottom left pane of the window looks broken-in. The space looks small enough for a child to squeeze through. Viri [[eldritch-blast\|eldritch-blast]]s the crossbeam of the window and blows the glass out. It's still not big enough for any of us to crawl through. Viri tries to jump up high enough to see through the window. She jumps up but cannot see much - a small table, the door to the room is closed.

We enter the house, coming into a small foyer, empty except for a footstool and another door. Scarlet opens the door. We walk into a room with a small kitchen and a set of stairs heading up. There is a small closet built under the stairs, and a small sitting area adjacent to them.

![[Pasted image 20231016214227.png\|Pasted image 20231016214227.png]]

Bent over in the kitchen, we see a very tall individual in a black coat and the back of their head bent downwards. They're bald and all we see on their head is pink. Genia and Sky can see something like a duster held in their hand, and they are dusting the kitchen table. They stand up and turn around to look at us all. We see a 7.5' tall man in a butler uniform (full suitcoat and everything), and their face looks stitched and stapled back together, skin saggy and stretched and patchworked back together. 

"Oh dear, I'm afraid we weren't expecting company this evening. How can I help you?"

Viri, "We just bought the place!"

### Raw Notes
"How did you know it was me?"

"You should know as well as anyone that I know every set of feet that sets foot in my forest."
