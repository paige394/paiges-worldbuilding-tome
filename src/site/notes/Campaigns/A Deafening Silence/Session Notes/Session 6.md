### Edited Long-Form Notes 
Present: Viri|Nate, Scarlet|Haley, Teras|Paige, Genia|Abby, Sky|Alex, Aoife|Sophie, Zephyr|Maysa

The walk back to town is uneventful. Scarlet, Viri, and Sky split off to go to Zippy's, and Genia asks where they are going, instead of heading straight to the sheriff for their reward.

Sky tattles and says Scarlet took an artefact that Zippy told them should be at that location, and Sky is unsure what Scarlet's intentions are so they want to follow through on this information. Viri simply says the money is not her priority now. Genia probes more about the weapon, and Sky says it was the blade of a powerful magical artefact. 

Aoife and Zephyr will also follow Sky and the lot to Zippy's home, while Genia and Teras continue on to the town hall.

Teras dumps the cultists' belongings onto Bam's desk in the sheriff's office. He gives us our coin with no issue, and we leave the rest to be picked up by the others. As we leave the town hall, Bert runs toward us calling out to get our attention. 

"I would like to apologize for my behavior tomorrow, I wasn't aware of your identity." Teras asks what he means by that. "You are not who I was expecting that morning!"

He heard our skills were very useful for the town, and given the recent cult activity his current security team has opted out of further contracts. He offers us 10gp/day to provide caravan security for a 3 day journey to Wheaton. Genia and Teras tell him they will think about it, before heading back to the inn to discuss.

---

Zippy finally remembers to disarm the door trap and invites the crew in when they arrive. He proudly has Tiri demonstrate some of her new magical tricks: [[produce-flame\|produce-flame]]. She has also started swearing, which Scarlet isn't impressed by.

Scarlet pulls out the blade and gives Zippy the full story of how it was acquired, the cult happenings, and the vision she had. He is very excited at the revelation that these items are indeed real and his friend's book was truthful about at least one location. She also tells him about the symbol in the vision, and Viri supplements with a description of her dream.

Zippy says it looks like a royal crest, perhaps from the Empire. Scarlet says it's not a crest of the Empire, at which point Zippy suggests it may be from the coast instead, but they should try asking the knowledge clerics in town.

Scarlet asks if it could really be a royal family that is branding their symbol into people, and Viri says that tracks with Kylian and what he gets up to. Various discussions ensue about how to learn more about the symbol, and at some point Zippy suggests that becoming The Earl's entourage for the upcoming ball would be a good way to get closer to the royalty of the Cape and learn more about this symbol.

Viri asks for clarity that The Earl is typically in Wheaton, which Zippy confirms. She suggests trying to find him there before he goes onto the cape so they can befriend him early and really ingratiate themselves into his entourage. Zippy slips a note into Viri's hand, which nobody else notices.

Scarlet tries to leave the blade with Zippy, but he insists they keep it so they will be able to match the blade to the hilt. Scarlet seems uneasy about this but acquiesces.

Viri asks Zippy if she can take Tiri for the night for a sleepover before they leave town, which he agrees to.

The group heads from Zippy's to the sheriff's office and collect their reward without issue. Viri returns his old badge, which he pins on top of his current badge. She looks at her note in private.

---

Genia and Teras agree to guard Bert, and Teras tries to convince him to raise to 12gp/day. They compromise on 11gp. He also asks if there is any more muscle. Genia and Teras say no, but they will discuss over dinner.

---

Aoife, as the group heads back from town hall, hears a familiar whispered voice in her head, "Don't trust the other short one!"

She yells, (out loud) "Hello?" Sky expresses concern but she shrugs it off. The voice whispers again, "She's a murderer!" Aoife NAT1s a nature check to recognize the voice. She tries to ask more questions, but gets no response.

At the inn, Viri, Sky, Aoife, and Zephyr sit at a table together. Scarlet doesn't sit as far away as possible, but she doesn't actively "join" the group of them. Genia and Teras approach. 

Genia asks how Zippy's was. Viri says good, and asks if they collected their coin, which Genia affirms. Teras asks if they want to make more. Viri seems interested in hearing the details. 

Genia gives the quick and dirty (but it's long and awkward). Viri chimes in first, and says she wants to come. Scarlet says if Viri goes, she goes. Aoife agrees as well. Tiri agrees too, which Genia expresses concern about. Scarlet says she'll be staying here with Zippy to learn more magic, not to worry. Sky and Zephyr also agree. 

Sky says if they're all traveling together, we should know about the sword. Teras says he doesn't really care, and Scarlet butts in to say that maybe "they" don't need to know. Sky tells us anyways. "A crazy cleric knows the location of some magic items that he wrote down, and the first one turned out to be right."

Genia makes a comment to Scarlet that "That's cool and all, but we've got our own thing going on." Scarlet is dismissive and Genia tries to assert that we won't steal their sword. Scarlet makes a comment that our first impression did not exactly leave a positive taste in their mouths about our ability not to steal things. Teras doesn't care for the conversation so he goes to find his own table again.

---

Sky goes to the temple of Gensea. They show the priests the symbol that Scarlet saw in her vision, but the priest apologizes and says they don't recognize it specifically. It looks like a royal sigil, possibly from the empire, but they don't know anything offhand. They will look into it overnight and ask Sky to return in the morning.

Next, Sky goes to Repara's temple to help with any nightly duties before praying. It is a grounding prayer, but nothing remarkable happens. 

---

Viri tucks Tiri in next to Scarlet at night. As she does, she tells her that growing up she also lived with kind of a Zippy, not her real parents, and that she turned out ok so she's sure that Tiri will be too. Tiri says, "Thanks to you, yeah." Viri promises that she will come back, and Tiri better have some new spells to show her.

Viri heads to Zippy's again. It seems the note asked Viri here alone. Zippy says he has something top secret that "some of the other folks you're acquainted with might not appreciate."

He takes Viri down a hidden hatch into a laboratory (according to the DM, Scarlet has seen this before). He specializes in strange planes and other places, and he has some friends he can ask about Viri's predicament. He begins casting a spell that includes a ritual circle, which he tells her not to break under any circumstances. He throws a vial into the circle which erupts into a pillar of fire, and as it dies down Viri sees a devilish figure in front of her. Large horns, white skin, black hair with red tints along the edges, red feathered wings.

"WHO DARES SUMMON ME TO HIS FEEBLE WORLD OF MORTALS," they stare down Zippy. "Oh, my dear."

Zippy, "Oh dear, you've come so far since last we spoke."

"It has been too long my love. Will you let me out of this silly little circle?" They move to hug Zippy, and their tone seems very affectionate.

"You know I can't do that. I wish for nothing more, but I cannot."

"Very well. But you still owe me a favor, Zippy."

"I know, but I am here to ask you for another. For my friend." The being turns to size Viri up, and Viri compliments their armor. "It could be yours for the low, low price of your soul!"

"Can't start with a finger?" She quips.

Zippy introduces Arturio Lancaster, his husband. Aruturio asks Viri what she wants. She tries to ask about the brand Kylian got, but Zippy says he won't be helpful in matters of politics. He asks Arturio if he knows where Viri may have come from as she doesn't seem familiar with the continent or any of the towns.

Viri describes the sphinx. Arturio comments, "Horrid creature with their riddles and whatnot." And then tells Viri it seems that she is from another world. She asks how many there are, and Arturio answers cryptically "As many worlds as there are worlds!" They seem intrigued by Viri's ability to have traveled here though.

He says it's likely the sphinx could reverse her travel, and then offers to send her home himself. For the price of her soul, of course. 

Before he goes, Arturio tells Zippy that some devils are passing out forbidden information to people in Zippy's world and he should keep an eye out. He vanishes dramatically.

Viri asks Zippy how they met. Zippy says that story is better saved for another day. Viri thanks him for the help. Now she has to find the royal seal and this sphinx. "And I have to find out how to free a soul from hell," Zippy comments. He says Arturio sold his soul to save Zippy, and he toils endlessly to return his lost love.

Zippy asks Viri to keep this meeting between them. She agrees. She also asks him for some of his dank stash. He jokes he'll give some up for the low, low price of her soul, and then gives her some for free.

---

At night, there is a light rain. Teras meditates after Genia goes to sleep, wondering about the lightning that sprung out of him during his rage. Despite the rain not being a thunderstorm, a single bolt of lightning appears in the shape of Teras' face. "That was fuckin weird," he goes to sleep.

---

The next day. 

Genia examines her tome more thoroughly this morning. Something new has appeared, but the rest of us are not privy to that information. 

Teras gets the crossbow from the cultist fixed up.

Viri and Sky go to the temple in the morning while Scarlet returns Tiri to Zippy. The priest has a similar image to they symbol, but it's not exactly the same. The snake's teeth are missing and the coloring is different but it is otherwise the same, the symbol of House Trevail. The patron of the house is Gwendolyn Trevail: a very old woman, who is close friends with the King of the Cape. 

Viri asks after the public's opinion of the house, but the priest says they aren't sure and the book doesn't have that kind of information. Viri thanks Sky and the priest. 

---

The entire party meets Bert at the merchant's guild. A covered wagon is piled full of crates and boxes. He pays us all for the first day, including slipping Genia and Teras their extra 1gp. We set off into the desert. 

Abby rolls a 7 for environment. The Empty Desert is as empty as the name suggests it is. Teras NAT20s perception, and even he can only see nothing for as far as the eye can see. No real vegetation, some soft hills, an occasional bird overhead. A harsh sand desert with a single road carved through it. 

Haley rolls a 3 for environment. The wind picks up. Some of us take buffeting damage from the strong sands. 

Teras makes some small talk with Bert, asking how he became a merchant. He gives the same answer as the last time they spoke, that he got tired of being a Lightkeeper and decided to start making money another way. Genia asks what his business is in Thistleton. He says about half of his goods are destined for Wheaton, the rest for Thistleton. He hasn't been in a long time so he's excited to catch up with some old friends (from his Lightkeeper days). 

Genia [[message\|message]]s Teras that she got another message from her friend. They head to the back of the caravan for a private conversation. Teras asks if it's worth it to try and pay Bert for his silence or just try to fly under the radar. They discuss pros and cons. Genia says her friend told her to "keep her new acquaintances close." They both don't seem to happy about it. 

The wind picks up further in the second half of the day. Otherwise uneventful until Bert calls that it's time to start looking for a place to rest. About a quarter mile North, off the road, we can see a crumbling stone statue on a pedestal at a crooked angle. Sky can tell it is religious in nature, a figure surrounded by a carving of fire and dust. 

Viri invites Scarlet to take a walk to the statue. Viri asks how she's doing. Scarlet says she's ok given the circumstances. Viri says she plans on heading to the Cape eventually, and she'd like Scarlet to join her. Scarlet says she'd be happy to go, it seems that fate or something has brought them together and they should stick together. Viri is worried about Kylian, unsure if the dreams are premonitions or visions of the past. She needs to find him. 

Viri asks if Scarlet believes in "all that bullshit, faith and worshipping and destinies and shit." Scarlet says she's not sure if the sphinx was fate or destiny, but having faith in something has given her a lot of good in life. Whether it is or isn't "real," her belief doesn't change and she doesn't spend her time worrying about it.

This statue is a representation of Blazein, goddess of fire and the desert. It seems like it is ever so slowly being swallowed by the earth. There is a shimmering force wall holding them back from the statue, and a plaque on it in Celestial. Viri and Scarlet cannot read it, but it looks like the words on the plaque are shifting around. Scarlet throws sand at the statue, and it slides harmlessly off the force field. 

Viri suggests someone is trying to protect it from vandals.

---

Aoife tries to talk to the voice in her head again, unsuccessfully. Sky, Zephyr, Genia, and Teras settle in for a rest.

Viri and Scarlet take first watch when they get back. Viri can see some of the birds we saw passing overhead in the day are now circling us in the night. Out of the corner of their eye, both see a gigantic shadow. A beast with roughly a hundred foot wingspan flaps in from the South, screams, and dives at the birds, catching one in its mouth and turning back South. The rest of the birds flee. Viri thinks something of this size could be a dragon, a roc, a wyvern, or maybe something unknown.

Aoife and Teras take second watch. Teras NAT20s on perception. Nothing further happens during the watch. 

---

The next day the winds have let up some. We receive our pay (including the hidden extra) and head out. We can all see that there are more critters in this area. Lizards, scorpions, spiders, some sparse vegetation. Scarlet can see, off to the right and buried under a bit of sand, the black shells of some *very* large scorpions. She points it out and suggests moving out of their way. 

Teras helps to pull the cart through looser sand off the path. We successfully sneak by the creatures laying in wait. 

As we crest a small hill, Sky spots are grouping of cacti and other small succulents to the south of the path (a few hundred feet or so) with a person tending to this grouping of plants. They point it out to the group. Bert says there's the odd weirdo that lives in the desert, it's probably one of them. 

As we pass, the gardener hears our cart and waves. She's wearing a single piece of white cloth that falls all the way down to her ankles. Sky waves back and the woman calls out, "Hello! Would you like some of my wares?" 

Sky asks what they are selling. She replies, "Succulents." And starts heading towards us. Bert is in a good mood, so he stops the cart for her. 

"It's good to see people. I've been out here a while without other people. Where are you coming from?" Bert replies and they make some more small talk. 

She offers succulents and cactus juice, "It has medicinal properties!" Aoife drinks the juice without hesitation. Zephyr and Sky will also take some, although less eagerly. Genia gets a succulent. The merchant insists our company is enough payment. 

All three juice drinkers pass their CON saves. Aoife gains the ability to cast [[augury\|augury]]; Sky, for the next few hours, has advantage on CHA checks, but disadvantage on INT and WIS checks; Zephyr, for the next few hours, becomes convinced that the horses can speak and she can speak back. Apparently the horses are considering unionizing.

Those three cannot make perception checks while we travel on. A sandstorm sweeps in, and we are buffeted by the sands once more. Bert recommends we settle in before it picks up more. Nobody notices the six bug-like figures sneaking towards us in the sandstorm.

Roll initiative.

### Raw Notes 
All present.

The walk back to town is uneventful. Scarlet, Viri, and Sky split off to go to Zippy's, and Genia asks where they are going instead of heading straight for the reward?

Sky tattles and says Scarlet took an artefact that Zippy said should be at that location, and Sky is unsure what Scarlet's intentions are so they want to follow through on this information. Viri says the money is not her priority now. Genia probes more about the weapon, and Sky says it was the blade of a powerful magical artefact. 

Aoife and Zephyr will also follow Sky and the lot  to Zippy's home, while Genia and Teras continue on to the town hall.

Teras dumps the cultists' belongings onto Bam's desk in the sheriffs office. He gives us our coin with no issue. As we leave the town hall, Bert runs toward us calling out to get our attention. 

"I would like to apologize for my behavior tomorrow, I wasn't aware of your identity." Teras asks what he means by that. "You are not who I was expecting that morning!"

He heard our skills were very useful for the town, and given the recent cult activity his current security team has opted out of further contracts. 10gp/day for a 3 day journey to Wheaton. 

Zippy finally remembers to disarm the door trap and invites the crew in. He proudly demonstrates some of Tiri's new magical tricks. She can make fire. She has also started swearing, which Scarlet isn't impressed by.

Scarlet pulls out the blade and gives Zippy the full story of how it was acquired, the cult happenings, the vision she had, etc. He is very excited at the revelation that these items are indeed real and his friend's book was truthful about at least one location. She also tells him about the symbol in the vision, and Viri supplements with her dream. 

Zippy suggests asking the knowledge clerics in town about the sigil, or it might be one of the royal families crests? Scarlet says it's not of the empire, so Zippy says their best bet is the coast. 

Scarlet asks if it could really be a royal family that is branding their symbol into people, and Viri says that actually tracks with Kylian and what he gets up to. Various discussions ensue about how to learn more about the symbol, and at some point Zippy suggests that becoming The Earl's entourage for the ball would be a good way to get closer to the royalty of the Cape and learn more about this symbol.

They also discuss where the remaining known locations of the artefact are. 

Viri asks for clarity that The Earl is (before the ball) in Wheaton, which Zippy confirms. She suggests trying to find him there before he goes onto the cape so they can befriend him early and really ingratiate themselves into his entourage. Lockie asks for a mysterious perception check (Zippy slides a note into Viri's hand, which nobody notices).

Scarlet tries to leave the blade with Zippy, but he insists they keep it to match the blade to the hilt. Scarlet seems uneasy about this but acquiesces.

Viri asks Zippy if she can take Tiri for the night, for a sleepover before they leave town, which he agrees to.

The rest of the 5 go to Bam and collect their reward without issue. Viri returns his old badge, which he pins on top of his current badge. She looks at her note in private. 

Genia and Teras agree to guard Bert, and Teras tries to convince him to raise to 12gp/day. They compromise on 11gp. He also asks if there is any more muscle. They would get 10gp/day. Genia and Teras say no, but they will discuss over dinner.

Aoife, as the group heads back form town hall, hears a familiar whispered voice in her head "Don't trust the other short one!"

She yells, (out loud) "Hello?" Sky expresses concern but she shrugs it off. The voice whispers again, "She's a murderer!" Aoife NAT1s a nature check to recognize the voice. She tries to ask more questions, but gets no response.

At the inn, Viri, Sky, Aoife, and Zephyr sit at a table together. Scarlet doesn't sit as far away as possible, but she doesn't actively "join" the group of them. Genia and Teras approach. 

Genia asks how their "Zippys" was. Viri says good, and asks if they collected their coin, which Genia affirms. Teras asks if they want to make more. Viri seems interested in hearing the details. Genia gives the quick and dirty (but it's long and awkward). Viri chimes in first, and says she wants to come. Scarlet says if Viri goes, she goes. Aoife agrees as well. Tiri agrees to, which Genia expresses concern about. Scarlet says she'll be staying here with Zippy to learn more magic, not to worry. Sky and Zephyr also agree. 

Sky says if they're all traveling together, we should know about the sword. Teras says he doesn't care, and Scarlet butts in to say that maybe "they" don't need to know. Sky tells us anyways. "A crazy cleric knows the location of some magic items that he wrote down, and the first one turned out to be right."

Genia makes a comment to Scarlet that "that's cool and all, but we've got our own thing going on." Scarlet says "that's cool," and Genia tries to assert that we won't steal their sword. Scarlet makes a comment that our first impression did not exactly leave a positive taste in their mouths about our abilities not to steal things. Teras doesn't care for the convo so he goes to find his own table again.

Sky goes to the temple of Gensea. They show the priests the symbol that Scarlet saw in her vision, but the priest apologizes and says they don't recognize it specifically. It looks like a royal sigil, possibly from the empire, but they don't know anything offhand. They will look into it overnight and ask Sky to return in the morning.

Viri promises that she will come back, and Tiri better have some new spells to show her.

Viri heads to Zippy's again. Zippy says "I wasn't sure you'd show up." It seems the note asked Viri here alone. Zippy says he has something top secret that "some of the other folks you're acquanited with might not appreciate."

He takes Tiri down a hidden hatch into a laboratory (according to the DM, Scarlet has seen this before). He specializes in strange planes and other places, and he has some friends he can ask about Viri's predicament. He begins casting a spell that includes a ritual circle, which he tells Tiri not to break under any circumstances. He throws a vial into the circle which erupts into a pillar of fire, and as it dies down Tiri sees a large horned devil in front of her. Large horns, white skin, black farmer with red tints along the edges, red feathered wings.

"WHO DARES SUMMON ME TO HIS FEEBLE WORLD OF MORTALS," they stare down Zippy. "Oh, my dear."

Zippy, "Oh dear, you've come so far since last we spoke.

"It has been too long my love. Will you let me out of this silly little circle?" They move to hug Zippy.

"You know I can't do that. I wish for nothing more, but I cannot."

"Very well. But you still owe me a favor, Zippy."

"I know, but I am here to ask you for another. For my friend." The being turns to size Viri up. Viri compliments their armor. "It could be yours for the low low price of your soul!"

"Can't start with a finger?" She quips.

Zippy introduces Arturio Lancaster, his husband. He asks Viri what she wants. She tries to ask about the brand Kylian got, but Zippy says he won't be helpful in matters of politics. He asks Arturio if he knows where Viri may have come from as she doesn't seem familiar with the continent or any of the towns.

The next day. 

Genia examines her tome more thoroughly this morning. Something new has appeared, but the rest of us are not privy to that information. 

Teras gets the crossbow from the cultist fixed up, and has the blacksmith teach him the basics of tuning it up (proficiency in blacksmith tools added, given as a bonus for notes). 

Viri and Sky go to the temple in the morning while Scarlet returns Tiri to Zippy. The priest has a similar image, but it's not exactly the same. The snake's teeth are missing and the coloring is different but it is otherwise the same, the symbol of House Trevail. The patron of the house is Gwendolyn Trevail (she is very old), and she is close friends with the King of the Cape. 

Viri asks after the public's opinion of the house, but the priest says they aren't sure and the book doesn't have that kind of information. Viri thanks Sky and the priest. 

We regroup at the inn and meet Bert at the merchant's guild. "We brought extras." A covered wagon is piled full of crates and boxes. He pays us all for the first day, including slipping Genia and Teras their extra 1gp. Sky elects to bring their horse with them. We set off into the desert. 

Abby rolls a 7 for environment. The Empty Desert is as empty as the name suggests it is. Teras NAT20s perception, and even he can only see nothing for as far as the eye can see. No real vegetation, some soft hills, an occasional bird overhead. Sand desert with a single road carved through it. 

Haley rolls a 3 for environment. The wind picks up. Some of us take 2 buffeting damage from the strong sands. 

Teras makes some small talk with Bert. How he became a merchant, etc. Genia asks what his business is in Thistleton. He says about half of his goods are destined for Wheaton, the rest for Thistleton. He hasn't been in a long time so he's excited to catch up with some old friends (from his Lightkeeper days). 

Genia [[message\|message]]s Teras that she got another message from her friend. 

They head to the back of the caravan for a private conversation. Teras asks if it's worth it to try and pay Bert for his silence or just try to fly under the radar. They discuss pros and cons. Genia says her friend told her to "Keep her new acquaintances close." They both don't seem to happy about it. 

The wind picks up further in the second half of the day. Otherwise uneventful until Bert calls that its time to start looking for a place to rest. About a quarter mile North, off the road, we can see a crumbling stone statue on a pedastal at a crooked angle. Genia and Teras ignore it. Sky can tell it is religious in nature, a figure surrounded by a carving of fire and dust. 

Viri invites Scarlet to take a walk to the statue. Viri asks how she's doing. She says ok given the circumstances. Viri says she plans on heading to the Cape eventually, and she'd like Scarlet to join her. Scarlet says she'd be happy to go, it seems that fate or something has brought them together and they should stick together. Viri is worried about Kylian, unsure if the dreams are premonitions or visions of the past. She needs to find him. 

Viri asks if Scarlet believes in "all that bullshit, faith and worhsipping and destinites and shit." Scarlet says she's not sure if the sphinx was fate or destiny, but having faith in something has given her a lot of good in life. Whether it is or isn't her belief doesn't change and she doesn't spend her time worrying about it.

This statue is a representation of Blazein, goddess of the desert/fire. It is slowly sinking into the earth (like over a very long period of time). There is a shimmering force wall holding them back from the statue. There is a plaque on it in Celestial. Viri and Scarlet cannot read it, but it looks like the words on the plaque are shifting around. Scarlet throws sand at the statue, and it slides harmlessly off the force field. 

Viri suggests someone is trying to protect it from vandals.

Aoife tries to talk to the voice in her head again.

Sky, Zephyr, Genia, and Teras settle in for a rest.

Viri and Scarlet take first watch when they get back. Viri can see some of the birds we saw passing overhead in the day are now circling us in the night. 3-4 birds circling. Out of the corner of her eye, both see a gigantic shadow, probably 100ft+ wingspan, flap in from the South, scream, dives at the birds and crunches a bird in its mouth and flies off back South. The rest of the birds flee. Viri thinks something of this size could be a dragon, a roc, a wyvern, or maybe something unknown.

Aoife and Teras take second watch. Teras NAT20s on perception. Nothing further happens during the watch. 

The next day the winds have let up some. The statue remains where it is. We receive our pay (including the hidden extra) and head out. There are more critters in this area. Lizards, scorpions, spiders, some sparse vegetation. Scarlet sees off to the right, buried under a bit of sand, the black shells of some *very* large scorpions. She points it out and suggests moving out of their way. 

Teras helps to pull the cart through looser sand off the path. We successfully sneak by the bugs laying in wait. 

As we crest a small hill, Sky spots are grouping of cacti and other small succulents to the south of the path (a few hundred feet or so) with a person tending to this grouping of plants. They point it out to the group. Bert says there's the odd weirdo that lives in the desert, it's probably one of them. 

As we pass, the gardener hears our cart and waves. She's wearing a single piece of white cloth that falls all the way down to her ankles. Sky waves back and the woman calls out, "Hello! Would you like some of my wares?" 

Sky asks what they are selling. She replies, "Succulents." And starts heading towards us. Bert has a good nature so he stops the cart for her. 

"It's good to see people. I've been out here a while without other people. Where are you coming from?" Bert replies and they make some more small talk. 

She offers succulents and cactus juice, "It has medicinal properties!" Aoife drinks the juice without hesitation. Zephyr and Sky will also take some, less eagerly. Genia gets a succulent. She insists our company is enough payment. 

All three pass their CON saves. Aoife 1 - gain the ability to cast [[augury\|augury]]; Sky 2 - for the next few hours, advantage on CHA checks, DIS on INT and WIS checks, becomes very social but more gullible; Zephyr 4 - for the next few hours she becomes convinced that the horses can speak and she can speak back. Apparently the horses are considering unionizing.

Those three cannot make perception checks while we travel. A sandstorm sweeps in, and we buffeted by the sands once more. Bert recommends we settle in before it picks up more. Nobody notices the six bug-like figures sneaking towards us in the sandstorm.
