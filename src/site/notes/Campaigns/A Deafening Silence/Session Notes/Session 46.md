### Bulleted Notes

### Edited Long-Form Notes 

### Raw Notes
 Heading down into the second floor, the constant rock shifting/rumbling gets a little louder. We can hear a carrion crawler munching on a vaguely humanoid body, and some of us can see it. There are a few lit torches that we can see.
 
Zefir can see a patch of fabric off to the side of the crawler which she recognizes as a symbol of Cape Lamar. Genia and Sky see a leather satchel nearby. 

We decide we should scare off the carrion crawler and see who the poor dead guy is, and then we can investigate the satchel after. Teras charges, Viri casts sleep. The spell is unsuccessful, but it grabs its attention. Seeing the whole party, it flees.

Teras investigates the corpse. It seems pretty fresh, and there are ripped patches of cloth identifying him as being from Cape Lamar, identifying him as A. Silverfoot. Teras rips off the name patch.

Chain Shirt holds up a hand, seemingly telling them to stay. Talbot asks him where he went. Chain Shirt says, "gift!"

Genia investigates the satchel. There's a bunch of tools Genia is not familiar with, and a notebook. The initials A. Silverfoot are present, and the most recent page is a log of the activities Silverfoot was doing to fix the elevator.

Nearby, we find evidence of a campsite (bedrolls, a few spare rations, some rope, etc.) that seems new, but everything else seems to be remnants of the mines. Scarlet sees a trail of blood that might lead us to the missing folks. The rest of us investigate different corners and crevices. Teras looks down the hole the [[carrion-crawler\|carrion-crawler]] disappeared down, but only sees darkness.

Viri finds an underground pond with some shape or thing at the bottom of it. It looks to be only 15-20 ft. deep, and upon closer investigation she sees a large cylindrical objects sticking out of the ground. She tries to pull it out with her mage hand, but something stronger pulls it back into place. She cannot see what pulled it. She tells us to stay away from the water.

The rest of us come over to investigate. It is staff-shaped. Teras suggests we get mage hand to tie a rope around the staff, and we all yank from on shore (Genia, Teras, Sky). We successfully pull it out, and it lands at our feet. It is an iron metal rod, roughly five feet long and 4 inches in diameter, with a small button. Genia pushes the button, and nothing happens. She drops it, and it floats in midair. Genia has heard of this before, it is called an immovable rod. 

We begin to follow the trail of blood. Scarlet can hear the skittering of long legs before a hoarde of spiders emerges from the caverns ahead of us.

We surround the sleeping spiders and crush them. Sky makes some goodberries, and then we continue on. In the room ahead of us, we see faintly glowing greenish crystal-like structures. First, we cross a rickety wooden bridge. We all make it over after some close calls.

Once over, we identify this as ketramine. We also see a huge chasm. As we approach, we feel a physical pull towards it. We set up a rope and the [[immovable-rod\|immovable-rod]] to let Viri walk towards the chasm. She can feel the force get stronger as she walks towards the chasm. 

Viri can't see the bottom of the chasm, but can see something moving in the shadows. Sky throws a light pebble into the chasm, but the darkness seems to swallow it. Talbot estimates that the pebble hits something 30 ft. down. Viri sees tentacles in the shadows, and then the rock hits something, stops, and begins to fall towards Viri. It smashes towards her chest and then sticks to her.

We retie the rope so Viri can go into the chasm. As she does, Talbot hears "Gift!" in his head and Chain Shirt pops out of the rock, holding a bunch of stuff in his hands. We ask him what's in the hole and he says "Me no go."

Viri makes it partway down the hole and gets a clear view of a creature with tentacles and sharp teeth. Chain shirt says "ROD!" and charges at the immovable rod as we all roll initiative.
