### Edited Long-Form Notes 
Present: Viri|Nate, Scarlet|Haley, Teras|Paige, Genia|Abby, Sky|Alex, Zephyr|Maysa

(quick retcon; Zephyr would have elected to drink the liquid in the fountain)

The party enters a foggy room with tall ceilings and winding hallways and branching paths reminiscent of a maze. The voice calls out, "No matter which path you take, you will come face-to-face with the slumbering beast at the center of our world." A slow patter of footsteps moves away. 

The fountain drinkers can see a clear set of footprints walking straight forward, but a fog obscures them as the reach the end of the hall. Genia loses "the sight" with double NAT1's on a perception check. Teras passes a survival check to take them down the right hallway. 

Scarlet and Zephyr take the lead as they both have "the sight." As we approach the next intersection, a panel in the middle begins to pulse with magnetic energy and pull Scarlet and Sky towards them (only two wearing metal armor). Scarlet holds her own, Teras grabs Sky to help them remain where they are. Scarlet leads us to the left.

Down the next hallway, a panel in the wall releases a bunch of ball bearings. Scarlet and Zephyr save, Teras saves, Genia fails and crashes into Viri (auto-fail), Sky also fails. It makes quite a clatter. At the next intersection, Zephyr and Scarlet lead us left again.

The next hallway releases a toxic gas. Scarlet rushes through, but Zephyr tries to power through and passes out, snoring. Teras shakes her awake, but as the snore fades we hear a similar noise continue up ahead in the maze. Scarlet leads us to the left.

The snore fades as we walk down the left hall. Scarlet and Zephyr see a white goo begin to bubble up out of the floor, and jump out of the way just in time. Genia and Teras also avoid it. Sky and Viri stumble right into it, and it hardens gluing them to the floor. They both try to rip their feet free, which Sky manages with a loud cracking sound as they break the hardened glue. Viri is unable to free herself, but asks Teras to just hit at the glue to crack it. Teras double NAT1s and chops into Viri's foot a little. She takes off the shoe to pull herself free, grumbling as she walks away. Scarlet leads us right.

We come into a room about 30ft across, octagonal with torches in each corner. A staircase stands across the way. In the middle of the room is a well-like structure, with a large slumbering creature wrapped around it. It glints gold, has scales and wings. We split to move in two groups around the side of the room. Genia, Teras, and Scarlet go left. Viri gives Scarlet a bardic inspiration as they part. Sky backs up as far down the hallway as they can and casts [[silence\|silence]] on the entire room, doing so without waking the sleeping dragon wyrmling (Scarlet identified it with a history check). Scarlet also knows that gold dragons are typically good- or neutral-aligned, so it is a little unusual to see them in an "evil" place. We make it up the stairs without incident. 

The next room appears to be a laboratory. Six stone slabs spread evenly around the room, with little instrument trays set up next to them. Bags hooked into decaying corpses laying on the three slabs to the left. On the right, three skeletons on slabs. Scarlet notices they are missing some of their smaller bones (fingers, toes, ribs) and that both the skeletons and corpses look humanoid, but child-sized. Across the room, we see the illusory figure again. "Can you confront the dark histories of our world? Will you be the ones to cleanse it?" They turn and walk up the staircase on the other side of the room. A door in the ceiling slides down to slam shut and close off the stairs. The corpses and skeletons rise.

Roll initiative.

Round 1
- Scarlet pulls out a rapier and invokes "rite of the dawn." (Teras notices) Her rapier begins to glow with a holy light. She attacks the closest skeleton (hit) and her blood rite adds some extra radiant damage. She one-hit kills, she hears a whispered "Thank you."
- The two remaining skeletons target Scarlet (hit, NAT20) with scalpels they grab off the trays. Viri tries to use cutting words on the hit, but doesn't roll high enough.
- Sky [[shillelagh\|shillelagh]]s their staff as a bonus action, and casts [[cure-wounds\|cure-wounds]] on Scarlet.
- Genia [[eldritch-blast\|eldritch-blast]]s the nearest skeleton (hit on AC).
- Zephyr tries to glean some more information about the situation, but is unable to. She moves up to join Sky and Scarlet.
- Teras rages, using his storm aura to strike out at the two nearest zombies. He also swings at the central zombie (hit) with his axe.
- Viri casts [[faerie-fire\|faerie-fire]] targeting the skeletons (pass, fail). She also casts [[healing-word\|healing-word]] on herself.
- All three zombies target Teras with slams (hit, hit on AC, miss).

Round 2
- Scarlet swings at the skeleton in front of her with her rapier (hit, kill). Another whisper, "Mother?"
- The remaining skeleton swings at Sky (miss).
- Sky smacks at the skeleton in front of them (hit, kill) and scatters the bones across the floor. A whisper, "Thanks."
- Genia [[eldritch-blast\|eldritch-blast]]s the zombie that hit Teras the hardest (hit).
- Zephyr shoots a zombie with a crossbow (hit) and moves a bit further into the room.
- Teras swings at the center zombie with his axe (hit) and activates his lightning aura (pass, fail/kill, fail/kill) turning two to dust. Two whispers, "Thank you" and "Free at last"
- Viri swings on the last zombie (hit).
- The final zombie slams into Teras (hit on AC)

Round 3
- Scarlet begins to investigate the room. She sees containers around the room partially full of small bones and bodily fluids.
- Sky swings at the final zombie (hit, kill). A final whisper, "Free from mother at last"

The stairs reopen and we hurry out of the room as fast as possible. In the next room (T-shaped, a decorative area rug, slightly taller than the previous rooms, a few decorative statues in the corners, a balcony on the far end) we see the illusory figure standing at the far end of the room. Two of the party can make out that they are, this time, not illusory. "Perhaps I underestimated you lot. Maybe you do have what it takes."

Roll initiative. (Aoife arrives).

Round 1
- Scarlet rushes forward and attacks with her crossbow (hit)
- Aoife attacks with her shortbow (miss), moves forward into the room, and [[hunters-mark\|hunters-mark]]s the figure
- Genia moves forward into the room and [[eldritch-blast\|eldritch-blast]]s the figure (miss)
- Sky casts [[shillelagh\|shillelagh]] on their quarterstaff and [[bless\|bless]] on Scarlet, Teras, and Genia
- The figure fires their crossbow at Scarlet (hit) and Aoife (hit), laughing maniacally
- Teras runs straight over the rug, which falls into a pit below, but Teras leaps out of the way in time. He rages, continues forward, and throws a javelin at the cultist (hit).
- Viri casts [[faerie-fire\|faerie-fire]] (pass) and yells at him to "Stop fleeing, coward, and fight us!"
- Zephyr shoots her crossbow (hit) and moves up a bit 

Round 2
- Scarlet continues moving forward and attacks with her rapier (miss)
- Aoife attacks with her crossbow (hit) and moves 
- Genia gets up close and personal, says something snarky, and casts [[inflict-wounds\|inflict-wounds]] (miss)
- Sky gets into melee range and tries to smack him with their quarterstaff (miss)
- The figure disengages, jumping up onto the railing. "It seems my time here has come to an end. I'm sure I'll be seeing you all again." 

He steps off the balcony and falls, smacking violently into the ground. The mask falls off, and the three at the balcony (Scarlet, Genia, Sky) can see a burned and scarred face with a small white wisp escaping the lips, shooting off to the northwest. 

Sky heals up Scarlet with some [[goodberry\|goodberries]]. Teras and Genia start looting. Scarlet asks the rest of the group if they can go back and explore the maze, potentially to free the dragon.

Genia finds something the cultist dropped on the balcony: a small metal key. On the table, Genia notices some interesting notes in Abyssal. They are the notes of "Mother Mary," discussion of attempting to harvest the blood of these children for magical spells. Also a drawing of a small box (3.5x2x2") made out of human bones with various arcane etchings all over it. There is no further explanation available. There is also a dagger tucked somewhere in the room, on the hilt is written in Abyssal "pain" and the letters glow faintly as Genia picks it up. 

Genia speculates that the key may go to the door set into the hillside. Viri inspects the drawing of the box, but can't quite understand. Teras also inspects the drwaing and recognizes a symbol that looks adjacent to necromancy symbols he's seen before. 

Scarlet reaffirms that she thinks the dragon may be trapped and that it won't hurt us as we make our way backwards through the tower. We investigate the lab as we pass through. We don't find the bone box, and we don't find any other objects that stand out. We do see some runes etched into the stone tables that indicate Mother Mary was using magic to "preserve" these corpses somehow.

As we descend to the maze floor, we sneak to the other side of the dragon room before trying to wake it up. Scarlet pulls out her alchemists' supplies and rolls a glass vial across the floor towards the slumbering beast. It wakes and roars, raising its head and we can see the chains encircling its neck. Teras gestures for the key and Genia hands it over willingly, so he holds it up as a method to persuade the dragon to not attack immediately. It remains suspicious of us but doesn't attack. 

Teras asks in draconic how long the dragon has been there, which he says he doesn't remember. He allows Teras to approach alone, but the key doesn't fit. Teras asks if anyone knows how to pick locks, and Viri says she does. The dragons tells Teras "one at a time," so he and Viri swap places. Viri picks the lock with the help of some [[guidance\|guidance]] from Sky, and the dragon thanks us before telling us it will repay the favor and heading up the stairs. Teras asks if we should follow it, but it says it will "find us when the time is right."

We backtrack and finally get out of the tower. As we exit into the late afternoon sun, Genia makes a WIS save (17) and no result is announced. We investigate the body of the cultist, finding 2gp, his crossbow and some bolts, his cloak and mask. We can also tell now that this is a female drow. Teras keeps the crossbow, mask, and cloak as well as 1gp. He gives the other 1gp to Genia.

The large steel door into the hill is unlocked by the key Genia found on the balcony. The door swings out, and we can see living quarters inside. There are some desks with scattered papers and a map of Bartholomew on the wall. Everyone heads in to investigate except for Viri, who stays outside looking rather uncomfortable. This is clearly where the cultists came from. 

The map details their entry and exit into and out of Bartholomew. There are two sets of cultists robes, a pin with the cult symbol, 63sp, a shortsword, a longsword, and a vial of black liquid. Genia uses her alchemists tools to check the vial, which she can tell is a poison that forces you to make CON save or fall asleep (drow poison). 

We find scattered papers about logistics of the operation, and one letter in undercommon, which Scarlet can read. "To Lorn, From Addicus. We await news of Cornelius' demise." Scarlet comments that some things aren't lining up, namely why exactly this cult wanted Cornelius so bad. "They're clearly bad, but they wanted to kill a werewolf?"

Finally, attached to the wall above the map, we see the broken-off blade of a longsword. Teras and Genia still don't know about the magic items of the seven. Scarlet identifies the blade as the "Blade of Tajeck the Slayer," and reaches up to take it down and receives a flash of an image: a warm parlor, shelves filled with books, a plush rug on the floor, a single red velvet armchair stationed at its center facing a crackling fireplace. The top of someone's head peeks over the top of the chair: a head of brown hair with a kiss of white at the ends. Above the mantle sits a crest (a curled black snake with its head raised on a red background) and the matching hilt of the blade. Scarlet does not recognize the symbol.

Teras sees Scarlet pause momentarily as she grabs the blade but doesn't comment.

Scarlet steps out to show Viri the symbol as the rest of us wrap up looting. Viri recognizes this symbol as the one that was branded onto Kylian in her dreams. Scarlet tells her where she saw it, and Viri says she thinks the symbol is connected to the man she was separated from.

On the walk back, Teras asks Scarlet if she knows "Plintus Zinstra." Scarlet says she's heard of them but they were some high-ranking official outside her order. (Out of character, she says she doesn't know them directly, but she knows of them from Janeus (the person she murdered). Plintus was a prior partner of Janeus.)

Genia asks Teras what he learned, which he shares. They make small talk about their next steps, which looks like they will be headed to Whispering Ridge to follow the trail of Plintus Zinstra.

Fin.

### Raw Notes 
Absent: Aoife

(quick retcon; Zephyr would have elected to drink the liquid in the fountain)

Up the stairs we enter a foggy room that is much larger than the previous one. 10' tall and winding walls that are reminiscent of a maze. "No matter which path you take, you will come face-to-face with the slumbering beast at the center of our world." We hear the voice, and then a slow patter of footsteps. 

The fountain drinkers can see a clear set of footprints walking straight forward, but a fog obscures them as the reach the end of the hall. Genia loses "the sight" with double NAT1's on a check. Teras passes a survival check to take them down the right hallway. 

Scarlet and Zephyr take the lead as they both have "the sight." As we approach the next intersection, a panel in the middle begins to pulse with magnetic energy and pull Scarlet and Sky towards them (only two wearing metal armor). Scarlet leads us to the left.

Down the next hallway, a panel in the wall releases a bunch of ball bearings. Scarlet and Zephyr save, Teras saves, Genia fails and crashes into Viri (auto-fail), Sky also fails. It makes quite a clatter. At the next intersection, Zephyr and Scarlet lead us left again.

The next hallway releases a toxic gas. Scarlet rushes through, but Zephyr tries to power through and passes out, snoring. Teras shakes her awake, but as the low rumbling snore fades we hear a similar noise continue up ahead in the maze. Scarlet leads us (incorrectly) to the left.

The rumbling snore fades as we walk down the hall. Scarlet and Zephyr see a white goo begin to bubble up out of the floor, and jump out of the way just in time. Genia and Teras also avoid it. Sky and Viri stumble right into it, and it hardens and now they're glued to the floor. They both try to rip their feet free, which Sky manages with a loud cracking sound as they break the hardened glue. Viri is unable to free herself, but asks Teras to just hit the glue. Teras double NAT1s and chops into Viri's foot a little. She takes off the shoe to pull herself free, grumbling as she walks away. Scarlet leads us right.

We come into a room about 30ft across, octagonal with torches in each corner. A staircase stands across the way. In the middle of the room is a well-like structure, with a large slumbering creature wrapped around it. It glints gold, has scales and wings. We split to move in two groups around the side of the room. Genia, Teras, and Scarlet go left. Viri gives Scarlet a bardic inspiration as they part. Sky backs up as far down the hallway as they can and casts [[silence\|silence]] on the entire room, doing so without waking the sleeping dragon wyrmling (Scarlet identified it with a history check). Scarlet also knows that typically gold dragons are good- or neutral-aligned, so it is a little unusual to see them in an "evil" place. We make it to and up the stairs without incident. 

The next room appears to be a laboratory. Six stone slabs spread evenly around the room, with little instrument trays set up next to them. Bags hooked into decaying corpses laying on the three slabs to the left. On the right, three skeletons on slabs. Scarlet notices they are missing some of their smaller bones (fingers, toes, ribs) and that both the skeletons and corpses look humanoid, but child-sized. Across the room, we see the illusory figure again. "Can you confront the dark histories of our world? Will you be the ones to cleanse it?" They turn and walk up the staircase on the other side of the room. A trap door in the ceiling slams shut to close off the stairs and the corpses and skeletons raise.

Sky heals up Scarlet with some [[goodberry\|goodberry]]. Teras and Genia start looting. Scarlet asks the rest of the group if they can go back and explore the maze, potentially talking to the dragon. Viri says she'll go with her.
