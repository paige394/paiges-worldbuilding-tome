### Bulleted Notes
- Cornelius has transformed into a werewolf and begins attacking the party, who put up a valiant effort but notice that the druid seems to be regenerating.
- Genia's patron intervenes, temporarily silvering the melee weapons of the entire party. 
- Once silvered, the party is able to kill Cornelius in a single round. Genia lands the killing blow.
- The former sheriff's brother, Bam, thanks the party for saving the town and offers a monetary reward for the services already performed, as well as an additional payment if they will hunt down and kill the remaining cultists.
- Viri successfully intimidates him into raising the reward, and the party accepts the deal.
- Viri and Zephyr bond a little over their "bartering" with the sheriff, and Viri invites Zephyr to come meet Zippy.
- Scarlet, Viri, Zephyr, and Aoife have a chat with Zippy in which he reveals that he wanted them to save the druid because he was from Rentlam Forest, where one of the artefacts of The Seven is located.
- Zippy also informs them he tracked the cultists' horses, who are now located at a creepy black tower in the foothills of Bartholomew (also an artefact location!).
- Zephyr attempts to sneakily rip out a few pages of the tome of prophecy, but is unsuccessful in her sneakiness. The rest admonish her, and she apologizes saying that where she's from you don't really ask for things.
- Zippy gives Viri a hint about a famous musician named "The Earl," who retired to Wheaton and will be performing in Cape Lamar for a royal ball.
- Teras and Genia search for the woman who paid them for the amulet, to no avail. They are successful, however, in gaining access to Cornelius' room and find two letters inside.
	- One is from a woman named "Carolyn," who apparently gave Cornelius the amulet that prevented him from wolfing out.
	- One is in elvish, which Viri later reads and reveals that two drow were caught in Rentlam Forest and revealed they had a plot on Cornelius' life.
- The innkeeper has been informed by the sheriff about their status as "town heroes," refunds their room fees, and gives them a free meal.
- Sky helps the sheriff bury Cornelius, clear the town square of cultists, and then begins to help injured townsfolk when they overhear that the Bishop/judge in Wheaton was recently killed.
- They also learn that a priest of Gensea recognizes the cult symbol, but cannot recall specific details. The priest will do some research and get back to them.
- Aoife, Zephyr, Scarlet, Genia, and Teras relax (separately) at the inn while Viri takes to the stage and plays a sweet tune about love and heartbreak.
- Teras and Genia thank Viri for her help and get her to read Cornelius' letter that was in elvish.
- Teras, Genia, Aoife, Viri, and Zephyr all finally introduce themselves and make very awkward small talk. Scarlet sits alone and stays out of it.
- At the temple of Repara, Sky learns that a retired Lightkeeper named "Seb" is being sent to Wheaton as a temporary replacement for the Bishop.

### Edited Long-Form Notes 
New initiative is rolled.

Round 9 - If only these were Twilight werewolves.
- Cornelius growls at Teras and attacks with his claws (miss), then tries to bite Viri (NAT 1, free opportunity attack). Viri swings at Cornelius (hit).
- Aoife fires at Cornelius with her crossbow (hit).
- Viri disengages, runs toward the buildings, and gives Teras bardic inspiration.
- Sky hears a howl and the sounds of fresh combat. They run in the direction of the scuffle, casting [[shillelagh\|shillelagh]] as they go.
- Scarlet flanks the werewolf with Teras, attacking with her rapier (hit) which inflicts both piercing and lightning damage (from her crimson rite?).
- Teras' lightning scar crackles in the presence of Scarlet's lightning, which only she notices. He attacks with his battleaxe (hit), and pushes Cornelius back into the cart with a shove of his horns.
Interlude: Genia hears a voice in her head. 
"It seems you've found yourself in a bit of a pickle darling, would you like some help? All you need to do is ask." The voice is familiar to Genia.
"I'm just trying to do what you asked - but it seems like something bad happened?"
"You're doing a wonderful job, and your friends are trying to handle the situation, but I think they could use a little extra punch!" Her patron suggests.
The edge of Genia's longsword suddenly looks shinier than the iron she is used to. Her patron has kindly silvered the melee weapons of everyone in the party.
- Genia runs back towards the fray.
- Zephyr moves to get a line of sight on the prone Cornelius and fires her crossbow (hit).

Round 10 - (A witty pun about silver spoons.)
- Cornelius tries to shove Teras prone (fails) and scratch him with his claws (hit).
- Aoife throws her now-silvered dagger (hit) and handaxe (miss).
- Viri casts healing word on Teras, then continues to run behind the building and hide. She digs for a cigarette, freaking out a bit.
- Sky assesses the injury status of the party and does not take action yet.
- Scarlet swings with her rapier (hit).
- Teras swings his greataxe (hit).
- Genia rushes Cornelius, swinging with her longsword (hit, kill). "Strike true, my dear!"

Cornelius' body does not transform back to a human state, it remains in its werewolf form.

Sky tries to [[spare-the-dying\|spare-the-dying]] on Cornelius, insisting that he was a humanoid and deserves justice. They admonish the party for striking to kill and not knock out. However, the spell is unsuccessful, and they can tell that the soul does not seem to want to return to this wolfish body.

The pairs of the group move to disperse, but a 3-ish-ft gnome in a suit very similar to the sheriff's runs towards them, attempting to stop them all. Teras and Genia ignore him and keep walking back to the inn, but Scarlet and the rest stop. Up close, they can see that the gnome has a blood-soaked sheriff's badge on his suit. 

He introduces himself as "Bam, younger brother of the late sheriff," and says he wants to thank the group for helping to save the town. 

Scarlet politely says that no thanks is necessary, but then moves to walk away with Viri, who doesn't acknowledge the man's presence at all.

"No, no please! I must insist, we have a monetary reward!" He calls out. Viri and Scarlet turn back slowly, and Teras and Genia stop in their tracks, suddenly interested in hearing the man out. Aoife and Zephyr also seem very interested by this proposition, but Sky seems only to care about getting the body out of the road and buried, which they assume the sheriff will also want to do.

Bam offers the group 5 gold now, and 5 gold to "finish the job. " He says that while it is unfortunate what happened to the druid, it was his fault for not disclosing or controlling his wolfish curse. Regardless of Cornelius' status, he heard that one cultist escaped, and he would like them and any remaining cultists to be killed for the safety of the town. In addition to the monetary payment, he will provide horses and free accommodations at the town hall.

Viri speaks up, saying that the town hall is a no go, so Bam offers to pay for our stay at the inn instead.

Teras seems reluctant about the proposition, and isn't sure they need the money since they will have a payout from the amulet, but Genia convinces him that having more money will make things easier.

Zephyr tries to persuade the new sheriff to up the bounty, saying "15 or nothing." Viri repeats that, trying to intimidate rather than persuade. She succeeds so hard he pisses himself, and then in a final act of defiance she rips his badge off. "You'll get it back when we get our gold."

He pulls out a new, clean sheriff's badge, which astounds Scarlet, and affixes it to his shirt. He asks if anyone will help him with the werewolf, and only Sky offers to help. Sky will also pull the cultists' corpses over into a pile and help tend to the injured townsfolk.

Before heading to their rooms at the inn, Teras and Genia stop by the tavern the woman who wanted them to steal the amulet was at. She is not there yet, and in fact the tavern is completely empty as most of the townsfolk are a bit rattled after the events in the town square. 

Teras asks Genia if she also saw his weapon turn colors, seeming frustrated and a little confused. She says she had a friend help us all out, and Teras grumpily tells her to tell her friend not to touch his weapons again. Genia laughs and says she probably won't, and they head to the Main Street Inn (on Main Street).

Scarlet, Viri, Zephyr, and Aoife all head down the road towards the inn.

Viri approaches Zephyr, "I like how you stood up to him back there!" 

Zephyr responds awkwardly, "Thanks for helping us get the extra coin."

Viri flips the badge like a coin and calls the sheriff a loser. Zephyr laughs and agrees, saying she has some bad history with the police where she's from. Viri asks about the first time she got arrested, and Zephyr admits, "I haven't been arrested...yet. So you never saw me."

Scarlet says that she and Viri are going to Zippy's to see what is up with this werewolf, and Viri invites Zephyr to come along cause "she's cool," then belatedly invites Aoife when she realizes she is also there. Aoife pipes up to ask if she can smoke one of Viri's cigs, who vehemently says no.

Scarlet tries to subtly tell Viri that she doesn't have to "pick up strays" just because they helped them in a fight. Viri says it is good to have allies, but Scarlet insists it's better to keep the group small. As the two bicker, Aoife tries to sneak a cig from Viri's pocket but fails miserably.

The four arrive at Zippy's house. It's mid-afternoon, and they can hear Zippy and Tiri talking inside. Scarlet wisely does not knock and instead yells out for Zippy , who answers the door and deftly avoids the net trap strung over the door.

"You survived! I didn't think ya had it in you!" He calls out to Tiri that she can stop working on the obituaries.

Scarlet asks if he knew the druid was a werewolf when he told her and Viri to save him, which Zippy denies. He then asks if they succeeded in saving him, and Scarlet says no but asks why it was so important. He does not answer as he has noticed Zephyr, who he has never met before. Zippy asks if the druid cloned "the little one, now there's two of them!" Scarlet explains that Zephyr was a captive in the cart, but helped them fight against the werewolf. He accepts that answer and invites them all in.

Zephyr scans the house as they walk in, and sees a little red creature surrounded by crumpled up balls of paper that she throws at Viri and Scarlet as they pass. The house is pretty messy, every surface sems to be covered. 

Zippy ushers everyone into the living room and pulls out a large tome, asking if any of the gathered party can read "this shit," (celestial), which Zephyr says she can. Even though she can read the language, Zippy gives a short summary of the contents of the book to her. He also finally tells them that the druid was important because he was from Rentlam Forest, where one of the items is supposedly located. 

Viri asks Zippy if he knows anything about Cornelius' amulet, which he says he does not. When she explains that he turned into a werewolf shortly after it was removed, Zippy conjectures it probably helped keep him from turning into a werewolf.

The party asks how Cornelius got turned into a werewolf, and Zippy says he would have to be bit by another werewolf. They ask where he would've gotten an amulet like that, and he says he's not sure. They ask what he knows about the cultists, and he says he doesn't really know anything...except where they went. He put some tracking magic on their horses, who are now located in the foothills of Bartholomew.

Scarlet remarks that him knowing their location is rather convenient as they were just hired to kill the rest of them. Zippy says that they can kill two birds with one stone, as one of the artefacts of The Seven is in the foothills. He also specifies that the cultists are in the terrifying black tower in the foothills, although that is not necessarily where the artefact is.

After some idle chatter,  Zippy gives Viri a helpful tip that she might want to head down to Wheaton if she is musically inclined. When she asks why, he explains that the best music he's ever heard was from a performer named "The Earl," who uses some fancy system to amplify his instrument. Most people think he is dead, but Zippy happens to know that he retired in the town of Wheaton (almost 50 miles due west of Bartholomew). He also mentions that there is a royal ball in Cape Lamar that The Earl is expected to perform at, so Viri could also try going there to catch him.

While Zippy and Viri are chatting, Zephyr tries to create a distraction (by [[druidcraft\|druidcraft]]ing some fire) and rip out some the pages of the book. Zippy doesn't react to the small fire at all, quite used to small explosions in his residence. When asked what she thinks she is doing, Zephyr covers by saying she just wanted some reading for the road. They all tell her it would have been much easier to just ask to borrow a copy, which Zippy says he will do if she gives him back the originals.

Zippy tries to turn this little fiasco into a moral lesson for Tiri about asking before you take something, but Viri insists sometimes it's better to ask for forgiveness and if "they" won't forgive, then "we make them regret it!" Tiri chants along, "Make them regret it!"

Scarlet suggests that they let Zippy be and find a bar in town. As they walk, Zephyr offers to heal Scarlet's hand, which she gratefully accepts. Scarlet warns the group that they should all keep the information they just learned to themselves when they travel to find the cultists as there are "a few unsavory types" that will be joining them (most specifically Teras and Genia).

We cut to Teras and Genia. Genia tells Teras that she wants to try and unlock the locked doors of the rooms he suspected belonged to the druid. As they walk in, the innkeeper calls them over and refunds them for the price of last night's room as the sheriff has informed them that they are town heros. Teras awkwardly tries to convince the barkeep to let them into Cornelius' room as agents of the sheriff. His persuasion skills are rather terrible, but the innkeep is easily bribed by giving him the cost of the night's stay back. 

Key in hand, Teras and Genia enter Cornelius' room. It seems sparse, but as they investigate they find two noteworthy letters.  Genia finds a letter that is only half-written, "Dear Carolyn, thank you so much for your help with my condition. The amulet has been working perfectly. I hope to visit you soon and thank you again in person."

Teras finds a letter addressed to Cornelius, written in a language he does not read, except for the name "Buggs" written in common at the bottom. He shows it to Genia, who recognizes it as elvish (which she unfortunately does not read).

Teras asks Genia what he can do with "all this," and holds out his coins (almost two whole gold!). She says he can buy food or drink, but he frustratedly tries to explain he wants some sort of trinket so that he can finally own something he earned himself. None of the shops looked open though, so he resigns himself to getting something in the next town. They instead go downstairs to get a hot meal, which happens to be pot pie.

After helping the sheriff bury Cornelius, while tending to the wounded Sky overhears that "someone killed the Bishop in Wheaton, and now this shit happens here, who knows what's going on?" Sky figures out the Bishop was a cleric of the god of judgement (he was also the town judge). 

Sky asks around if anyone recognizes the emblem they picked up from the cultist. A priest of Gensea recognizes it, but they don't recall specifics. They offer to do some research for Sky and let them know later if they find anything.

All their helping done, Sky decides they needs to touch base with Repara, so heads to the temple instead of straight back to the inn.

Aoife, Zephyr, Viri, and Scarlet arrive at the inn. All the temples in town are closed and it seems like many travelers have cleared out (empty stables, quiet streets, etc.). Some tables at the inn are occupied, including one with Teras and Genia, who look rather unfriendly at the moment. The innkeeper stops them as well and refunds the rooms that have already been paid for. 

Viri asks if she can play on the empty stage, which the innkeeper happily allows. As she gets set up, Scarlet heads to the tavern across the street to get some much-needed drinks for her and Viri. The tavern is a little busier than when Genia and Teras visited, now that the initial panic has passed. Scarlet orders two glasses of whiskey, which the bartender offers at a discount "for the heroes of the town."

Viri plays a sweet, peaceful tune in direct contrast to her general vibe. The song is about a woman with white hair who fell in love with a man who left her and broke her heart. A middling performance for Viri, but still clearly powerful as a large half-orc woman in the inn bursts into tears. 

Teras and Genia approach Viri to thank her for her assistance in battle. Genia also asks if Viri can read the letter we found in the druid's room. The others are able to eavesdrop on the conversation, despite Genia trying to be sly.

Viri can infer from the letter that Buggs is a fellow druid from Rentlam Forest. He is writing to warn Cornelius about increased infiltrations. They caught two drow sneaking into their town a couple of days ago, and in interrogating discovered a plot on Cornelius' life. Zephyr, Genia, and Scarlet know what drow are but the rest don't. Zephyr walks up to Viri and Teras and Genia to explain, startling both Teras and Genia. Genia asks if Zephyr was a wolf, and she says yes but not like Cornelius.

Teras awkwardly asks if they should do introductions. Teras, Genia, Aoife, Viri, and Zephyr introduce themselves. Scarlet stays out of it for now, and Sky is not present. 

Teras attempts to compliment Viri's playing by saying she's better than he is, which prompts her to ask if he plays. He says no, and she tries to give him a beginner's instrument but he refuses, saying he's "not a performer."

Cut to Sky, who overhears that a retired Lightkeeper will be taking over in Wheaton until a new bishop can be reinstated. The Lightkeeper's name is "Seb." 

Fin.

Cornelius does not transform back into a human; his body stays wolfish.

Sky tries to [[spare-the-dying\|spare-the-dying]] on Cornelius, "He is a humanoid who deserves justice! Why would you strike to kill instead of knock him unconscious?" The spell is unsuccessful, the soul does not seem to want to return to this body.

Teras grabs Genia and they head to the tavern.

Scarlet wipes her knife off, wraps her cut hand, and goes to look for Viri. 

Everybody else also begins to disperse and head to their various inns.

A 3-ish-ft gnome in a suit similar to the sheriff runs towards the group as we begin to disperse, yelling "Wait!"

Teras and Genia keep walking back to the inn. Scarlet and the rest will stop. The gnome has a blood-soaked sheriff's badge on his suit. "Bam," younger brother of the late sheriff, wants to thank the group for helping to save the town. 

Scarlet says that no thanks is necessary and also starts to walk away with Viri, who doesn't acknowledge the man's presence at all.

"No, no please! I must insist, we have a monetary reward!"

Viri slowly turns, as do Genia and Teras. Aoife and Zephyr seem very interested. Sky only seems interested because the sheriff will likely want to clear the body out of the road.

Bam offers us 5 gold now, and 5 gold to "finish the job. " He says it is unfortunate what happened to the druid but it's his fault for not disclosing/controlling his wolfish curse. He says he heard a cultist escaped, and "finishing the job" would involve...finishing the job (killing the rest of the cult). He will provide horses and free accommodations at the town hall.

Viri says she would rather not stay there, so he offers to pay for our stay at the inn.

Teras is unsure of if they really need the money, but Genia convinces him that having a little money will make things easier.

Zephyr says "15 or nothing." Viri repeats that, trying to intimidate him. She succeeds so hard he pisses himself, and then she tries to rip his badge off. "You'll get it back when we get our gold."

He pulls out a shiny, clean, sheriff badge and put it back on. He asks if anyone will help him with the werewolf, and only Sky offers to help. Sky will also pull the cultists' corpses over into a pile and then begin to help tend to the injured townsfolk.

On the way back to the inn, Teras and Genia stop by the tavern the woman was at. She is not there yet. 

Teras asks Genia if she also saw his weapon turn colors. She says she had a friend help us all out, Teras tells her to tell her friend not to touch his weapons again. Genia laughs and says she probably won't, and they head to the Main Street Inn (on Main Street).

Scarlet and Viri head to Zippy's, walking along the road with Zephyr and Aoife before they split up. 

Viri approaches Zephyr, "I like how you stood up to him back there!" Zephyr responds awkwardly, "Thanks for helping us get the extra coin."

Viri flips the badge and calls the sheriff a loser, Zephyr laughs and agrees, saying she has some bad history with the police where she's from. Viri asks about the first time she got arrested, and Zephyr says "I haven't been arrested...yet. So you never saw me."

Scarlet says they are going to Zippy's to see what is up with this werewolf, and Viri invites Zephyr to come along cause "she's cool," and belatedly invites Aoife.

Aoife asks if she can smoke one of Viri's cigs, who vehemently says no.

Scarlet tries to tell Viri that you don't have to "pick up strays" just because they helped them fight. Viri says it is good to have allies, and Scarlet says it's better to keep the group small.

Aoife tries to sneak a cig as they walk, but fails miserably.

Scarlet, Viri, Aoife, and Zephyr arrive at Zippy's house. It's mid-afternoon, and they can hear Zippy and Tiri talking inside. Scarlet wisely does not knock and instead yells out for Zippy and throws a small stone at the door.

"You made it!" He dodges out of the way of the triggered net. "You survived! I didn't think ya had it in you!" He calls out to Tiri that she can stop working on the obituaries.

"Did you know the druid was a werewolf when you told us to save him?" Scarlet asks.

Zippy said he was unaware, but asks if she saved him. Scarlet says no, but asks why he wanted them to save the druid?

Zippy asks if the druid cloned "the little one, now there's two of them!" Scarlet explains that Zephyr was a captive in the cart but helped them fight the werewolf. He accepts that answer and invites them all in.

Zephyr scans the house as they walk in, and sees a little red creature surrounded by crumpled up balls of paper that she throws at Viri and Scarlet. The house is pretty messy, every surface sems to be covered. Zippy ushers everyone into the living room.

Zippy pulls out the tome from last night and asks if any of the gathered party read "this shit," and only Zephyr gives an affirmative answer.

Zippy explains the book briefly to the newcomer. Talked to the father of the universe, claims he had visions of the artefacts of The Seven, etc. He explains who the Seven are, and that Mordresh (mentioned in the book) was also named by the original messenger of the book. 

The druid was important because Cornelius was from Rentlam Forest, where one of the items is supposedly located. 

Viri asks Zippy about the amulet, and Scarlet says "Yeah the amulet the minotaur and that other one took." Zippy conjectures it probably helped keep him from turning into a werewolf.

The party asks how he got turned into a werewolf, and Zippy says he would have to be bit by another werewolf. They ask where he would've gotten an amulet like that, and he says he's not sure. They ask what he knows about the cultists, and he says he doesn't really know anything...except where they went. He put some tracking magic on their horses, who are now located in the foothills of Bartholomew.

Scarlet reveals that they were hired to take care of the remaining cultists. Zippy specifies that they are in the terrifying black tower in the foothills.

He says that the tower has been here as long as he as, and when the party inquires how long that is he answers " a couple decades at least."

Zippy asks Zephyr where she's from, and she tries to lie but is unsuccessful. He acknowledges that it would be weird to tell a stranger where you're from.

Zippy gives Viri a helpful tip that she might want to head down to Weahton if she is musically inclined. The best music I've ever heard, from "The Earl," who retired in the town of Wheaton (almost 50 miles due west of Bartholomew) or possibly in Cape Lamar. He uses some fancy system to amplify his guitar. Most people think he is dead. There is a royal ball in Cape Lamar (large city in the center of a non-empire Kingdom) that The Earl is expected to perform at. 

Zephyr tries to create a distraction ([[druidcraft\|druidcraft]] some fire) and rip out some the pages of the book. Zippy doesn't react to the small fire at all, quite used to small explosions everywhere. She still goes to grab some of the pages, in plain view of everyone else. She covers by saying she just wanted some reading for the road, which everyone seems to buy. Zippy asks for the pages back but says he will happily make them some copies.

Zippy tries to turn it into a moral lesson for Tiri about asking before you take, but Viri insists sometimes it's better to ask for forgiveness and if they won't forgive, "we make them regret it!" Tiri chants along "make them regret it!"

After the whole debacle, Scarlet suggests finding a bar. Zephyr offers to heal Scarlet's hand, which she gratefully accepts. As they walk, Scarlet warns that they should all keep the information they just learned to themselves when they travel to find the cultists as there are "a few unsavory types."

We cut to Teras and Genia. Genia wants to try and unlock the 2/3 locked doors Teras suspected belonged to the druid. AS we walk in, the bartender calls us over and refunds us our night's cost at the behest of the sheriff. Teras tries to convince the barkeep to let them into Cornelius' room as agents of the sheriff. His rizz magic doesn't work, but the innkeep is easily bribed by giving him our night's cost back. 

We go up to Cornelius' room. It seems sparse, but as we investigate we find two noteworthy letters. Genia finds a letter that is only half-written, "Dear Carolyn, thank you so much for your help with my condition. The amulet has been working perfectly. I hope to visit you soon and thank you again in person. " Teras finds a letter addressed to Cornelius, from Buggs, written in a language I do not read and Genia does not read. She recognizes it as elvish. We pocket the letters. We also find some loose change. 

Teras asks Genia what he can do with "all this," and holds out his coin. She says he can buy food or drink, but he frustratedly tries to explain he wants some sort of trinket so that he can finally own something he earned himself. None of the shops looked open though, so he resigns himself to getting something in the next town.

After helping the sheriff bury Cornelius, Sky overhears that someone killed the Bishop in Wheaton, and now "this shit happens, who knows what's going on?" Sky figures out the Bishop was a cleric of the god of judgement as he was also the town judge. Sky asks around if anyone recognizes the emblem they picked up from the cultist. A priest of Gensea recognizes but they don't recall specifics. They offer to do some research for Sky though and tell them what they know.

Sky needs to touch base with Repara, so heads to the temple instead of straight back to the inn.

Aoife, Zephyr, Viri, and Scarlet arrive at the inn. All the temples in town are closed and it seems like many travelers have cleared out (empty stables, quiet streets, etc.). Some tables at the inn are occupied, including one with Teras and Genia. The innkeeper stops them and refunds the rooms that have already been paid for. 

Viri asks if she can play, which the innkeeper happily accepts. She will need some time to get set up though. Scarlet heads to the tavern to get drinks to bring back to the inn. The tavern is a little busier than when Genia and Teras tried to walk in. Scarlet orders two glasses of whiskey, which the bartender offers at a discount. She brings a glass for Viri and settles in to watch her performance. 

Aoife and Zephyr get food at the bar. Scarlet sits alone. Teras and Genia give off "don't sit with us" vibes. Aoife offers to sit with Zephyr. 

Viri plays a sweet, peaceful tune in direct contrast to her general vibe. The song is about a woman with white hair and how she fell in love with a man who left her and broke her heart. A mid performance roll, but a large half-orc woman bursts into tears. 

Teras and Genia approach Viri to thank her for her assistance in battle earlier. Genia also asks if Viri can read the letter we found in the druid's room. The others try to eavesdrop successfully. 

> Buggs is a fellow druid from Rentlam Forest. He is writing to warn Cornelius about increased infiltrations. "They caught two drow sneaking into their town a couple of days ago, and in interrogating discovered a plot on Cornelius' life."

Zephyr, Genia, and Scarlet know what drow are but the rest don't. Zephyr walks up to Viri and Teras and Genia to explain, startling Teras and Genia. Genia asks if Zephyr was a wolf, and she says yes but not like Cornelius.

Teras awkwardly asks if they should do introductions. We get Aoife, Viri, and Zephyr's name. Scarlet stays out of it for now, and Sky is not present. Paige awkwardly lets them know Teras is not a real name and is just the gnomish word for "monster." 

Teras awkwardly compliments Viri's playing by saying she's better than he is, which prompts her to ask if he plays. He says no, she tries to gift him a beginner's instrument but he refuses, saying he's "not a performer."

Cut to Sky, who overhears that a retired Lightkeeper will be taking over in Wheaton until a new bishop can be reinstated. The Lightkeeper's name is "Seb."
