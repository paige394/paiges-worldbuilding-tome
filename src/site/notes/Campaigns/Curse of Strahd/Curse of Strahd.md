## Recent Events
Kolyan Indirovich, Burgomaster of the [[Campaigns/Curse of Strahd/03 Locations/Village of Barovia/Village of Barovia\|Village of Barovia]], was slain last night by the monsters prowling after dusk.

[[Campaigns/Curse of Strahd/02 NPCs/Ismark Kolyanovich\|Ismark Kolyanovich]] told you that [[Campaigns/Curse of Strahd/02 NPCs/Ireena Kolyana\|Ireena Kolyana]] will willingly leave for Vallaki after her father’s burial. He also revealed that Kolyan had been intercepting and burning letters from [[Campaigns/Curse of Strahd/02 NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Count Strahd von Zarovich]] to Ireena.

At the [[Campaigns/Curse of Strahd/03 Locations/Village of Barovia/Church of the Everlight\|Church of the Everlight]], Father Donavich revealed his divine connection was severed and asked you to reclaim his holy symbol from a “profane beast” wearing his son’s skin. In the undercroft, you found Doru still lucid. He resisted bloodlust when tested by Marlene, and willingly returned the symbol.

In the village square, you saw Ireena publicly curse the villagers’ cowardice and Strahd himself. After returning to the [[Campaigns/Curse of Strahd/03 Locations/Village of Barovia/Burgomaster's Mansion\|Burgomaster's Mansion]], you overheard Ismark and Mary discussing Mary’s missing daughter [[Campaigns/Curse of Strahd/02 NPCs/Gertruda Ulbrek\|Gertruda]]. Marlene also discovered two unsent letters from Kolyan, one to Strahd and one to [[Campaigns/Curse of Strahd/02 NPCs/Baron Vargas Vallakovich\|Vargas Vallakovich]], pleading for aid.
