Rose and Thorn are the children of Gustav and Elisabeth Durst. They starved to death in their bedroom at the [[Campaigns/Curse of Strahd/03 Locations/Durst Estates\|Durst Manor]] after being locked away by their mother.

Rose is the older of the two siblings. She is fiercely protective of her younger brother, and has a great curiosity about the arcane. Her diary contains the few spells she was able to learn, including [*light*](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1585), *[figment](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1528)*, and [*electric arc*](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1509). It also contains various mundane entries about her life before her mother's descent into madness, such as her friends, her non-magical studies, and Miss Klara.

Thorn is the younger of the two siblings. He is a shy boy who looks up to his older sister, and through her teachings was able to learn the spell [*telekinetic hand*](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1715).
