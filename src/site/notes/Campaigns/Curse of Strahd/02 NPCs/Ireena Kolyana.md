Ireena Kolyana appears as a poised young woman, with a steady gaze and a quiet strength about her. Though grief lingers in her eyes, there’s no trace of helplessness. She carries herself with the self-reliance of someone who’s had to survive in a harsh land all her life. She speaks plainly and acts with a practical kindness, quick to help but unwilling to be coddled, and there’s a stubborn spark beneath her calm exterior that suggests she won’t be easily intimidated or dismissed.
