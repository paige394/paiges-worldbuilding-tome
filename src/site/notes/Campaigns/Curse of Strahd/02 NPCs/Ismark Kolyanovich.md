Ismark Kolyanovich is a courageous and compassionate figure in the cursed land of Barovia. As the son of the late Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich, Ismark has taken on the mantle of leadership, striving to protect his people from the malevolent grasp of Count Strahd von Zarovich. With a strong sense of duty and a heart filled with determination, Ismark seeks aid from outsiders to free his sister, Ireena, from Strahd's pursuit and the danger of the recent sieges that have plagued the village.
