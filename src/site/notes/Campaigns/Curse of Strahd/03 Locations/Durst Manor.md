The players first encounter this stately manor after wandering a long road in a strange, misty forest. It stands at the end of a small cul-de-sac, kept company by a dilapidated longhouse for farmhands, and a large but ruined stable. 

The house itself stands four stories tall, and is made of cold stone, narrow windows, and high-peaked roofs. From the outside, it looks weathered, but candlelight flickers softly from the windows on the lower floors. After receiving no response to their calls, but finding the doors unlocked, the players begin exploring the manor.

### A Brief History 
This manor is owned by the Durst family. The most recent occupants appear to be Elisabeth and Gustav Durst, as well as their children [[Campaigns/Curse of Strahd/02 NPCs/Rosavalda and Thornboldt Durst\|Rosavalda and Thornboldt Durst]].
