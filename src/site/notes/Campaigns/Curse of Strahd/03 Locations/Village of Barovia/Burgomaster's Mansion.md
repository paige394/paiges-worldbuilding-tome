Though the largest house in town, the Burgomaster's mansion is a simple building. The ground floor contains a simple kitchen, dining room, and drawing room.

The Burgomaster, Kolyan Indirovich, and his two children, [[Campaigns/Curse of Strahd/02 NPCs/Ismark Kolyanovich\|Ismark]] and [[Campaigns/Curse of Strahd/02 NPCs/Ireena Kolyana\|Ireena]], live here.

## People of Note
### Kolyan Indirovich
Kolyan Indirovich is the current Burgomaster of the [[Campaigns/Curse of Strahd/03 Locations/Village of Barovia/Village of Barovia\|Village of Barovia]]. He is a stern man, but not unkind. It's clear that recent events have been taking a toll on him, as he has a large bandage covering one arm and deep bags under his eyes.
