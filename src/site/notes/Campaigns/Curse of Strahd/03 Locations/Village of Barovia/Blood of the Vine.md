## Description
The tavern itself is a 60-foot-square building, once finely appointed but now grown shoddy with age. The sign above the entrance reads “Blood on the Vine,” though careful inspection reveals it was once “Blood of the Vine” (an "n" has been scratched over with the "f"). 

Inside, a blazing hearth fire provides scant warmth to the few patrons inside. The barkeep, Arik, is a permanent fixture. He is strangely detached and emotionless. Three Vistani sisters are also frequently found here. They are cruel, catty, and shameless gossips.

The tavern only has wine or water to drink, and Ismark informs you that the food is abysmal. There are no rooms for rent here.

GM-only info! Keep playing to reveal :)
