The Church of the Everlight stands on the Northwest end of the [[Campaigns/Curse of Strahd/03 Locations/Village of Barovia/Village of Barovia\|Village of Barovia]]. It is a relatively small building, with a chapel and two other enclosed rooms. There is also a sizeable, but well-kept graveyard behind the Church.

## NPCs of Note
### Father Donavich 
Father Donavich is a priest of the Everlight. He has been grieving the loss of his son, Doru, since he left to siege [[Campaigns/Curse of Strahd/02 NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Count von Zarovich]]'s castle. More recently, he has been grieving his return, as "a profane beast wearing my son's skin."

### Doru
Doru is a young man and the son of Father Donavich. He led the uprising against [[Campaigns/Curse of Strahd/02 NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd]], believing that he could protect his love and his family. The rebellion failed, and Doru watched as Strahd slaughtered his companions before turning him into a vampire spawn.

Doru was commanded to return to the Church and his father when the sieges on the village began, and has been trapped in the undercroft of the Church since.
