## Description
The sole general store in the village of Barovia, Bildrath’s Mercantile is a narrow, dimly lit shop stocked with only the barest essentials. Bildrath has a monopoly on trade within the village and is keenly aware of his power. He sells only basic adventuring gear priced five times its normal cost, knowing that people desperate for supplies have no alternative.

Bildrath occasionally trades with passing [[Campaigns/Curse of Strahd/04 Factions/Vistani\|Vistani]], ensuring that his shelves remain stocked, but he never takes on risk for his customers. He offers no sanctuary from danger, nor does he ever bargain. His favorite saying:  
> *“If you want it badly enough, you’ll pay for it.”*

If tensions rise, Bildrath calls upon his nephew, **Parriwimple**, whose immense strength makes him an intimidating enforcer. Though strong and loyal, Parriwimple is slow-witted and easily manipulated by his uncle.

>[!abstract] Exterior
>Flickering, yellow light seeps through cracks in the heavy curtains that cover this shop’s windows. A small, hammered-metal sign beside the door declares it to be “Bildrath’s Mercantile.”  
>  
>The shop is narrow and foreboding, its weathered walls scarred by age and neglect. Inside, the faint shuffle of movement suggests someone within.

## Conditional Events
>[!abstract] First Entry
>The interior is dim, with only a few lanterns providing weak illumination. Tall, crowded shelves line the walls, holding a haphazard collection of goods: rope, candles, torches, and other travel necessities. The air smells of old wood, dust, and faint mildew.  
>
>Behind a counter near the back of the store, a thin man with sharp eyes and a shrewd expression regards you carefully.  
>  
>“Welcome to Bildrath’s,” he says flatly. “If you need something, you’ll find it here. And if you don’t see it, you don’t need it.”  

If anyone hesitates or protests his prices, Bildrath uses his favorite response:
>"If you want it badly enough,” he says, tapping the counter, “you’ll pay for it.”  

If the characters become aggressive or disruptive, Bildrath loudly calls, “Parriwimple!” 
>[!abstract] Parriwimple
>From the storage room, a towering young man lumbers into view. His hulking strength is obvious, even beneath his leather tunic, and he regards your group with confusion.  
>  
>“Trouble, Uncle?”  
>  
>“Aye, show them out.”

## Features of Note
- **Monopoly:** Bildrath is the only supplier of goods in Barovia. He only sells common adventuring gear of Level 1 or less, with the exception of a silver holy symbol of the Everlight. The gear costs five times as much as the listed price.  
- **Curtained Windows:** Heavy curtains keep prying eyes out, but they also hide what goes on inside the shop from passersby.
- **Secure Storage:** A reinforced storeroom in the back holds extra stock. Parriwimple often rests here when not working.

## NPCs of Note
### Bildrath Cantemir 
**(LN human commoner)** – Greedy, shrewd, and entirely self-serving. Maintains polite manners until crossed, then turns cold and dismissive.  
  - *Personality:* Pragmatic, opportunistic, self-interested.  
  - *Motive:* Profit above all else; survival through neutrality.  
  - *Quote:* “If you want it badly enough, you’ll pay for it.”
  - *Combat Notes:* Bildrath avoids direct conflict and immediately calls for Parriwimple if threatened.

  - *Personality:* Gentle-hearted but easily manipulated. Deeply loyal to his uncle.  
  - *Motive:* Wants to make Bildrath proud. Avoids violence unless ordered.  
  - *Combat Notes:* Devastating in melee combat. Strength is obvious even at a glance.

## Notes / GM Tips
- Bildrath has no reason to aid the PCs unless profit is involved. Even if the village faces immediate danger, he remains neutral.
- Parriwimple is the only person or thing left that Bildrath cares about, other than gold.
- Bildrath may offer to sell information about the valley and village—for a steep price.
- Use Parriwimple’s *gentle giant* nature to create interesting tension:
  - PCs can potentially persuade him to defy Bildrath with kindness or persuasion checks, though this is difficult.  
  - He has a childlike demeanor and responds well to simple, direct requests.
