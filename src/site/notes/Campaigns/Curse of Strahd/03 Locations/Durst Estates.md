## Overview
The players first encounter this stately manor after wandering a long road in a strange, misty forest. It stands at the end of a small cul-de-sac, kept company by a dilapidated longhouse once used for farmhands, and the burnt ruins of a large stable. 

The house itself stands four stories tall, and is made of cold stone, narrow windows, and high-peaked roofs. From the outside, it looks weathered, but candlelight flickers softly from the windows on the lower floors.

## People of Note
These estates once belonged to the Durst family, a wealthy Barovian household who owned and operated a small granary and farm.

Elizabeth and Gustav durst were the heads of house. Also in the house were [[Campaigns/Curse of Strahd/02 NPCs/Rosavalda and Thornboldt Durst\|Rosavalda and Thornboldt Durst]], and Klara, the family nursemaid.

## Player Discoveries
The adventurers braved the horrors of the house and pieced together the Durst family's sinister history. They cleansed the house of the family's legacy and escaped, battered but alive.

### An Apparent History
Elizabeth Durst was the head of a secretive cult practicing in occult magics of unknown origin. She appears to have a great reverence for the lord of the land, a man named [[Campaigns/Curse of Strahd/02 NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd von Zarovich]]. 

Her husband, Gustav, had an affair with the nursemaid Klara, which resulted in a bastard son named Walter. When Walter was born, Elizabeth took her vengeance. She killed her husband in their bed and cut off his head. The nursemaid, Klara, fared far worse. Elizabeth kept her alive for days while she mutilated her, feeding small pieces of the woman to Walter, now an undead abomination with an endless hunger.

Elizabeth locked her children, [[Campaigns/Curse of Strahd/02 NPCs/Rosavalda and Thornboldt Durst\|Rosavalda and Thornboldt Durst]], in their room when they began to pester her about the horrendous sounds coming from the basement, and left them there to starve.

At some point, she received a letter from [[Campaigns/Curse of Strahd/02 NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich\|Strahd von Zarovich]] dismissing her and her paltry followers.

While it is unknown exactly how the manor fell into its haunted state, it seems that the last actions of any living Durst family members happened long ago. The Manor lived on, however, luring adventurers into the eery mists of [[Campaigns/Curse of Strahd/03 Locations/Barovia\|Barovia]].
