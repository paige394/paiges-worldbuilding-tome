Wren may seem somewhat aloof to the others at this point. She is rather direct, no nonsense so far and a little stiff when trying to make small talk or get to know her new companions. As far as her physical appearance, her height, pale skin, and pointed ears give away her elven heritage. Her long, silver-blonde hair is always braided back and she wears hide armor with a bright red cape. She has an aura of confidence and power, and her golden eyes are very striking.
