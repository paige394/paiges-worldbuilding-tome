Dr. Clink is a short and thin Goblin, with no hair and bright redish-green skin. He constantly wears welder goggles and his alchemists kit, which is held up by straps over his shoulders and around his waist and consists of several pouches, vials, jars, boxes, and notebooks. He wears plain kaki pants, a comfortable black shirt, a white doctor's robe, and plain brown shoes. As long as his intelligence is not too off-putting, he comes across as rather amicable and caring.

GM-only info! Keep playing to reveal :)
