Toussaint is a warpriest of Ragathiel. He is tall and broad-shouldered, with half his face covered by a black steel mask that appears to have been scorched by flames. A faint blue glow comes from the eye behind the mask, while his visible eye is hazel. Scarring creeps down the side of his neck beneath the mask. He wears perfectly polished scale mail, a hooded dark cloak, and a simple chain bearing Ragathielâ€™s sword-and-flame symbol around his neck. Prayer beads hang neatly from his belt. His posture is perfect and rigid, his voice calm and measured. A bastard sword sits perfectly centered on his back. When at rest, he is utterly still, like a statue. His hands are marked with precise, deliberate scars, almost like tally marks.
