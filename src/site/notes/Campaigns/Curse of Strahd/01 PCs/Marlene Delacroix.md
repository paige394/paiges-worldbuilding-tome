Marlene Delacroix is serious, strong, and keeps to herself. She walks with confidence and poise, and is a little too used to commanding the attention that you can tell sheâ€™s trying too hard to reject. She has deep red wavy hair, golden hazel eyes, and freckled tan skin from years spent outside under the blazing sun.
