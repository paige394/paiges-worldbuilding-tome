## Peoples 
The predominant ancestries of the nation are listed here, ordered from most to least common.  

## Languages
The languages commonly spoken in the nation appear here, listed alphabetically.  

## Religions
**Religions** This lists the religions and philosophies commonly practiced in the nation. If a nation has a state religion, this is indicated in parentheses following that religion. If a nation has prohibited any religions, those are listed in a Prohibited entry following the common religions.  

## Other Characteristics
**Other Characteristics** A nation might have distinctive features that set it apart from other nations, such as the predominance of firearms in Alkenstar. Each such feature is detailed in this entry, though a nation rarely has more than one or two of these entries, and many don't have any.  

## Primary Exports
This lists the nation's primary exports, such as raw materials, finished goods, services, and other resources. If the nation has no exports of note, this entry is omitted.  
## Primary Imports
Much like primary exports, this entry details the resources commonly imported by the nation. Like exports, if the nation has no imports of note, this entry is omitted.  

## Allies
**Allies** This entry lists other nations, and occasionally large organizations, allied with the nation. It is omitted for nations with no significant relationships.  

## Enemies
**Enemies** Other nations (and sometimes organizations) that oppose the nation appear here. This entry is omitted for nations with no enemies to speak of.  

## Factions
**Factions** Any significant organizations or factions operating within the nation are listed in this entry.  

## Threats

## Significant NPCs
**Significant NPCs** The final section of the nation's stat block presents the most significant NPCs of that nation, including its ruler (if it has one). These may not be the most powerful or influential individuals in the nation, and instead are those most likely to be known by people within and outside of the nation.
