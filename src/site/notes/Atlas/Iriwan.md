## Government 
A **Confederation of Clans**, where each clan governs its own territory semi-autonomously but sends representatives to a central council known as the **Council of the Jade Serpent**. Leadership is a blend of hereditary chieftains and elected spiritual guides, balancing temporal power with religious authority.
## Ruler
**High Chieftain Xilana Varu**, a respected leader chosen through a ritual of trials and spiritual visions. Xilana is both a fierce warrior and a keeper of sacred knowledge, embodying the unity of the clans.

## Capital
**Sathaya** _(pop. 285,000)_ — A sprawling **Shifting City** built on the river delta with multi-tiered wooden structures woven into the jungle canopy and supported by magically buoyant platforms. During the wet season, Sathaya drifts gently with the currents, becoming a vibrant floating metropolis connected by waterways and watercraft. When the dry season lowers the rivers, Sathaya remains afloat, transforming into a semi-permanent island city, a testament to Iriwan’s ingenuity and magical heritage.

  ## Geographical Description
Iriwan is a land of lush, seasonally vibrant landscapes. The bulk of the country is dominated by dense tropical forests that swell and recede with the rains, interspersed with open savanna-like woodlands during the dry season. Vast river systems carve through the land, swelling to powerful torrents during monsoon months and shrinking to navigable streams in the dry season. Towering mountain ranges in the interior create cooler, mist-covered highland zones with cloud forests, offering refuge for rare plants and animals. The seasonal shifts shape the rhythm of life, with festivals and agricultural cycles closely tied to the monsoon rains.
