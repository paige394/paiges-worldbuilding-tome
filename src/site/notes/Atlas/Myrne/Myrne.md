## Government 
Myrne is ruled by a **High Table of Houses**, composed of the leaders of eight ancient noble families who control feudal fiefdoms across the land. Each house maintains its own army, courts, and culture, while swearing nominal allegiance to the High Table. When greater threats loom—such as incursions from the Shadowfell-scarred **Gloamsreach**—the High Table elects a **Warden-Regent**, a temporary sovereign empowered to lead the nation through peril.

## Ruler
**Warden-Regent Albrecht Delacroix**, Lord of House Delacroix. Known for his unflinching sense of justice, measured ruthlessness, and symbolic association with vengeance and divine order.

## Capital
**Duskwatch** _(pop. 45,000)_ — A fortress-city perched above the western cliffs of the **Gloamsreach**. Though neutral territory, Duskwatch is heavily influenced by the Warden-Regent’s house. The High Table meets here, and the city’s watchlights—massive braziers fueled by blessed oils—burn perpetually to ward against shadow incursions.

## Peoples 
Myrne
Dhampir - a minority, but prevalent due to the influence of the Shadowfell
Goliaths
Goblins
Fetchlings (Kayal)
Ysoki

## Languages
Common
Undercommon
Terran
Necril - Forbidden but studied in secret; sometimes found in old Gloamsreach texts.

## Religions
Myrne has no state religion; instead, each noble house venerates a **patron deity** aligned with its values and history. These faiths influence the laws, customs, and architecture of each fiefdom. Interfaith tension sometimes causes political rifts.

However, **Pharasma**—goddess of death and fate—is universally acknowledged. Her funerary rites are respected across all houses, and every village, no matter how small, maintains a shrine or cairn in her honor.

**Prohibited:** _Zon-Kuthon_, _Urgathoa_, and open worship of _undead_ or _shadow-deities_ is banned by the Warden-Regent’s decree. That said, heretical cults are rumored to thrive in the depths of the **Gloamsreach**.

## Other Characteristics
- **The Gloamsreach**: A vast basin of haunted forest and blackened earth at the heart of Myrne, tainted by the Shadowfell. Though the magical corruption does not typically extend beyond its borders, its oppressive aura has shaped the entire nation’s culture. Some believe it is alive, sentient, or a prison for something older than death.
- **The High Table**: Each house has equal status on the High Table, but in practice, alliances, assassinations, marriages, and vendettas constantly shift the balance of power.
- **Shadow-Touched Ecosystems**: Near the Gloamsreach, flora and fauna evolve into bizarre forms. Alchemists and magicians risk life and limb to extract these reagents.
- **Wardcraft**: Myrne’s people practice superstitious, protective sigil magic. Wardcraft involves bone charms, iron talismans, and ash symbols that guard against spiritual corruption and shadow incursions.

## Geographical Description
Myrne is a bleak and windswept land shaped by survival and shadow. Much of the country is rocky tundra, pine-choked forest, and harsh valleys, with a cold, wet climate that becomes increasingly frigid in the mountainous north. The land’s defining feature, however, is the **Gloamsreach** — a vast, central region scarred by a planar bleed from the Shadowfell. Once a great valley rich with life, Gloamsreach is now a nightmare of twisted trees, blackened earth, and endless gloom, where unnatural creatures roam and even the air feels heavy with despair.

While the magical corruption of the Shadowfell is largely contained within the borders of the Gloamsreach, its psychological and cultural effects ripple across the land. Myrne’s people live with a constant sense of vigilance and fatalism — every story, every tradition, every family name echoes with loss, resilience, and the thin line between light and dark.

The east of the country is bordered by the **Sable Marches**, a range of jagged cliffs and mountains that separate Myrne from its more fertile neighbor, forming a natural defensive barrier that has both isolated and protected the nation.
