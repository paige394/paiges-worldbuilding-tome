## Government 
Meritocratic Council-State
The Assembly of Sages governs Najarad through a meritocratic academic structure. High-ranking scholars from various fields—ethics, law, elemental theory, history—are selected through public discourse and published debate. Rule is rooted not in lineage or conquest but in one’s contributions to the greater good through knowledge
## Ruler
High Sage Zahran al-Qiran, the elected Grand Logician of the Assembly, holds ceremonial and executive power. He is a master jurist in divine law, known for synthesizing celestial principles with secular ethics—often quoting from both the _Scroll of the Sun_ and the _Concordance of Abadar_ in his rulings.
## Capital
**Aqharat** _(pop. 312,000)_ – A bastion of stone domes, alabaster courts, and hanging gardens, Aqharat is the cultural and spiritual seat of Najarad. The **Argent Spire**, a high tower of magical silver-veined quartz, is home to the **Sapphire Conclave**, an inter-disciplinary council of spellcasters, historians, and theologians. Public oration, debates, and legal judgments are performed in open marble amphitheaters.
