## Government 
There is no unified government over the Astragali Isles. Instead, each of the five major islands governs itself through local traditions, usually led by a **Council of Captains**, **Harbormasters' Circles**, or mystic-religious figures. Once a year, representatives gather at the **Tidebone Moot**, a rotating summit held on one of the five large islands, where binding agreements are made by consensus or divinatory casting (commonly with astragali dice, bones, or star-readings).
## Ruler
No single ruler; each major island has a locally recognized leader, often a **First Captain**, **High Seer**, or elected **Harborlord**. On the island of **Tamarra**, the **Oracle of Waves** serves as a neutral arbiter in major disputes between islands.

## Capital
There is no formal capital, but **Sevezzar** (pop. 48,000), on the island of **Tamarra**, is the largest and most cosmopolitan port. It hosts the **Tidebone Archives**, a semi-sacred library of divinatory records and sea charts maintained by neutral mystics.

## Peoples 
- Humans (majority)
    
- Halflings (especially islander communities)
    
- Tengu (well-known as navigators and wind-speakers)
    
- Sea Elves (especially around the southern isles)
    
- Undine and other water-touched planar scions
    
- Aarakocra-like avian folk (optional, reflavored as native sky-watchers)

## Languages
Aquan, Common, Elven, Halfling, Tengu, Varisian

## Religions
- **Desna** (state religion in some island-states; goddess of travel and fate)
    
- **Gozreh** (common among sailors and storm-callers)
    
- **Pharasma** (especially among diviners and bone-readers)
    
- **Besmara** (worshiped on some islands — less as a pirate queen and more as a symbol of independence and cunning)
    
- **Prohibited:** None officially — but necromantic or coercive divination is taboo in most ports

## Other Characteristics
- The region is a haven for independent seafarers, charter-traders, mystics, and explorers
    
- **Divination magic** is widespread and culturally normalized — used for navigation, contracts, and even political elections
    
- Navigation often relies on a mix of **astrological paths**, **bone-lore**, and **magical compasses** attuned to fate
    
- Some of the smaller islands are said to **move** slightly, drifting with magical currents

## Geographical Description
The Astragali Isles span a vast range of climate zones — from humid tropical atolls in the north to jagged, frostbitten rocks in the far south. Many smaller islands form coral reefs or rise abruptly from the sea, remnants of ancient volcanic activity. Some are inhabited by fey-touched or elemental beings, making them notoriously dangerous or unpredictable to map.

## Significant NPCs
**Significant NPCs** The final section of the nation's stat block presents the most significant NPCs of that nation, including its ruler (if it has one). These may not be the most powerful or influential individuals in the nation, and instead are those most likely to be known by people within and outside of the nation.
